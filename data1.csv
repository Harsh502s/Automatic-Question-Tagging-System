I am trying to think and research for use cases that can beneficial search experience using Generative AI. There are two things,

The final search results that can be more relevant and personalised per user. This would take time and more effort - in terms the backend search service to change/upgrade etc.
The more I am trying to focus how can generative ai be leveraged and provide to benefits on the client side while user is actually search. One thought I had:
used to generate new keywords and topics that can be used to improve the search engine's coverage of a particular topic. This can help to provide more relevant results to users.

I wanted to understand what other use case have you witnessed/seem where generative ai can really helpful while user is actually searching (on the client side experience)
",['search'],"One use case which pops into my mind is that of Query Expansion. Gen AI can analyze user queries and expand them with synonyms, or contextually relevant keywords, which allows for more comprehensive search results and increased coverage of the desired topics.Another one which might be useful is the Auto-tagging and Categorization. It becomes easier for search engines to organize and present results in a structured manner when content is tagged and categorized.Use case which might be difficult to implement will be like Multilingual Search."

GPT beam search length (number of tokens),"
Background: I'm currently trying to use GPT to give me numerical scores, and looking for tips on prompt design, see my previous StackExchange post.
To craft good prompts it seems important to have a good understanding of how the generative model works...
Question:
How many tokens ahead does GPT 3.5 look with its beam search feature?
Extra context: I found it hard to find good references for beam search, a decent starting point seemed to be huggingface blog post.
I tried asking BingChat about GPT-3.5 beam search length: BingChat replied that it was 10 tokens but could only give a 'reference' to an OpenAI API page which did not seem to support the claim. I couldn't find any other results online.
Why I care? Suppose I have a long theatre review and want to score how impressed the critic was by the quality of acting on a scale of: -5 extremely unimpressed to +5 extremely impressed.
My prompts currently ask the model to finish the reply with a sentence in the form:
""Overall the critic was very impressed by the quality of acting - score 4.""
But perhaps by asking the model to continue generation I can make the prompts more reliable. E.g. I could ask the model to subsequently explain the score with a quotation from the text; e.g. along the lines of
""Overall the critic was very impressed by the quality of acting - score 4/5 - and indeed that 'Mark Strong's performance stole the show'""
Knowing beam search length would really help me design prompts like these (which ask for the continuation of text after a numerical score to improve reliability).
","['hyper-parameters', 'gpt', 'sentiment-analysis', 'prompt-design']","I don't quite get the connection between Why I care and Beam Search... it seems you are confused by what beam search is, since you talk about beam search lengthHowever, beam search is about the width, not the length... at each timestep, the transformer outputs a distribution over tokens, thus for each token (for simplicity, think about them as words) you have a probability $p$ that that was the correct next word.However, it's very hard for models to predict hard probabilities (0/1) since the data that it's been trained is noisy, so almost everything might come after everythingFor this reason, if you just sample, you might sample a word that is with $p\approx 0$, but still greater than 0... for this reason, Beam search just limits this sampling on the next top-N words/tokens, thus at each timestep, you get the distribution over all the words, you take the top-N next words, you renormalize the distribution, and you sample from only those top-N words, avoiding going in area of the distribution that is unlikely just for a single bad sampleIn other words, Beam search does not limit your output length, it's just a tradeoff between the greedy option (just take the most likely word) and the naive sample one (sample words according to the outputted distribution)"
Prompt engineering GPT for numerical scores?,"

Background: I am currently working on an NLP project using GPT 3.5 via the OpenAI python API.
Engineering good prompts seems to be the most critical part of my pipeline so far. Crucially I have long input texts, for which I want to get numerical sentiment scores for a variety of different questions in a ZERO SHOT setting.
There are many possible applications such as predicting nuanced scores on different aspects (plot, acting, staging etc) of a theatre show from a long detailed review; or the sentiment of a twitter response to a new political policy (emotional objections, economic objections, moral objections).
Question: What is best practice to extract reliable numerical sentiment scores from GPT models?
What I've tried: Looked for guidance on the OpenAI cookbook  and explored many associated links. It seems like existing suggestions for sentiment scoring usually use embeddings in a setting where a small number of labelled samples are available. Following heuristics from various prompt engineering sources I have used a pipeline of iteratively asking for detailed summaries and then more concise summaries culminating in a single sentence and finally a score. This has yielded impressive results; indeed I suspect such a 'prompt-pipeline' may yield more sophisticated sentiment scores than fine-tuning approaches, unless one has the luxury of extremely large amount of labelled data.
However, converting these final sentences to numeric scores is still somewhat unreliable. I couldn't find specific advice online.
What is best practice?

How can CAPTCHAs be used for both user verification and ML training?,"
CAPTCHAs (e.g. requiring a site visitor to click all the images of traffic lights in a grid of images) are often used throughout to Internet to verify that a site visitor is a human rather than a bot.
Many people claim that the providers of the CAPTCHA service (often Google) also use these CAPTCHAs to train their machine-learning algorithms by getting the site visitors to (unknowingly) label training data for supervised learning of image-recognition algorithms.
But I don't see how the (alleged) overt and covert functions of CAPTCHAs - verifying the user's humanity and labeling future training data - can be done at the same time. It seems to me in order to distinguish humans from bots, the images need to already be reliably labeled by the CAPTCHA provider so that the CAPTCHA knows whom to let through. But in order for users to provide input to future ML training runs, the images can't already be reliably labeled.
So what exactly is the claim here? Are the images in online CAPTCHAs already labeled or not? Is the claim that some CAPTCHAs are being used to block bots, and others are being used to label future training data, but no individual CAPTCHA is performing both tasks? If so, will CAPTCHAs in the second category let you through no matter which images you click? Is there any public information or estimates about the relative proportion of these two categories of CAPTCHA?
A quick search will turn up dozens of sites that claim that Google uses its CAPTCHAs to label future training data, but I haven't found any that address this point.

How to set up CNN with correct dimensions for a specific MRI image translation task?,"
Recently at my internship I have been asked to come up with a simple neural network pipeline for taking MRI image volumes containing phase data at each location and training a neural network which predicts the magnetic susceptibility at these locations.
So far I have been able to successfully import the source/target volumes into Pytorch, but I have been getting tons of sizing errors when trying to implement a simple version of U-Net. I have verified that the source/target data are both (210,224,160), so I assume at some point in this network I am creating a mismatch of dimensions. I messed around with the dimensions a bunch, and even though the network is able to get through the downsampling part of the forward pass, it fails at various parts of the upsampling state. Currently it's failing on concatenating x with x2 and throwing the error ""RuntimeError: Sizes of tensors must match except in dimension 1. Expected size 104 but got size 105 for tensor number 1 in the list.""
I'm sure the mistakes are really obvious, but I haven't been able to see it. I've also sort of ruined the code I started with by messing with the dimensions in such a haphazard way, the part where I randomly made a bunch of places in the upsampling layers size 96 is a good example (I just wanted to get it to run more lines without throwing an error).
Here's the code I have:

Implementing a GAN with control over the output class,"
I am trying to accomplish the reverse of the typical MNIST in machine learning using a GAN - instead of predicting a number from an image of a digit, I want to reconstruct an image of a digit from a number. The traditional GAN, however, isn't designed for this use case, as it is designed to generate images similar to training data directly without being given an input. One way to work around this issue that I've thought of is to take a train feature digit, connect it to a densely-connected layer Dense(784), reshape it to (28 x 28 x 1), and then proceed with the generator as one usually does for a GAN. However, this seems like ""fooling"" the neural network to make up weights out of thin air, and I doubt this would work properly.
How can I modify a GAN so that it takes single-digit inputs without resorting to the aforementioned approach?
","['neural-networks', 'generative-adversarial-networks', 'mnist']","This is a common use case for GANs, you want the output to be conditioned on some controlled input, as opposed to just random seed data.This Medium article cGAN: Conditional Generative Adversarial Network — How to Gain Control Over GAN Outputs walks through creating your example almost exactly (using MNIST digits and selecting which one you want).The basic changes you need to make to turn your ""freely choose class"" GAN to a conditional GAN:Add input to the generator, in addition to the random seed, that describes the class you want to generate. For a digit generator, that might be a one-hot array for the digit class you want it to make.Add the same input to the discriminator, alongside the image input. That may involve having inputs at different layers, so you can combine CNN and fully-connect layers more easily. Typically you would concatenate the class choice to the flattened last CNN layer, and use this concatenated vector as input to the first fully-connected layer. But you could concat the class data to any nn layer before the output.Train as before, whilst tracking which class is being faked (or real) and ensuring the generator and discriminator are fed the correct class details during training.You could optionally provide incorrect labels for some real or fake images, and score appropriately, but that is not 100% necessary. The discriminator should detect that something declared to be a '1' looks more like a '2' and mark it as fake, without needing to be specifically trained for it."
How to handle large dimensionality differences between state and action inputs in a reinforcement learning predictor?,"
I'm currently writing code for a reward predictor function r=f(s,a) in reinforcement learning, where 's' is the state with 256 dimensions (the embedding dimension after visual input is processed by an encoder) and 'a' is the action with 6 dimensions. I could use a Fully Connected Neural Network (FCNN) for this function.
I'm wondering if it's necessary or beneficial to adjust the dimensions of the state or action inputs given the significant difference in their dimensions? For instance, should I consider directly increasing the dimensionality of the action to match the state dimensionality using a linear layer? Or are there other methods to handle these large dimensionality differences?
I welcome any related discussions, or references to similar concept code or code repository links.

What machine learning methods can be used to minimise the difference to a target 2D boolean matrix with differing sizes?,"
I have a problem whereby given an input, the difference that is generated from the model to a target 2D boolean matrix needs to be minimised.
The target boolean matrix can be of varying shape, i.e: 10 x 10, 100 x 100, 500 x 500 etc depending on the input. Naively, I was thinking of having 100 output nodes for the case of 10 x 10 matrix but the number of outputs becomes too huge when it is 100 x 100 matrix and so forth.
Alternatively, I was thinking about a regression model that outputs the number of 1 labels. However, this approach doesn't consider the position of the values in the 2D matrix.
Is there a way to efficiently learn a model for this problem?

Comparing the cost of neural network training models,"
I need to compare two different neural network architectures to compare the training complexity for the same objective function:

Standard fully connected neural network with N inputs, 1 hidden layer with 10 hidden neurons and N outputs
Graph Neural Network with N inputs (N nodes with one input in each), 2 filter taps concatenated with an MLP with 1 input, 1 hidden layer with 10 hidden neurons and 1 output (for every node, so totalling N outputs, same as the above MLP)

In theory, GNNs scale much better with the number of inputs due to having less parameters to learn (can someone point me out to neat complexity results with GNNs wrt. nodes for a symmetric graph structure?). Still, I want to compare this in practice and want to know how to measure this comparison, especially when using many hyperparameters and the fine tuning approach during the training process. Both architectures are trained with the same accuracy over the same number of (random) data samples. Note that the graph structure is also fixed.

Which search algorithm expands nodes closest to the goal?,"
I want to know which search algorithm among A* and Best-First Search and Greedy First Search expands nodes closest to the goal. I have three opinions about A* and Best-First Search and Greedy First Search. As far as I know, Best-First Search is a category of search algorithms that includes A* and Greedy First Search as special cases.
So, which one is the correct choice for this question, as all three are based on the heuristic function?
","['comparison', 'search', 'a-star', 'best-first-search']","Update: A*, BFS and GFS are all informed search strategies meaning that they expand the nodes according to an evaluation function, $f(n) = g(n) + h(n)$, where $g(n)$ is the cost of the path from start node to current node $n$, and $h(n)$ is a heuristic function, which provides an estimate of the cheapest path to from current node $n$ to the goal node.A* is in general more efficient than BFS and GFS because it employs a heuristic function that basically provides the remaining distance between the actual node and the goal node (indeed, it depends on how you implement it.) So, in this way, A* tends to explore less nodes in general because it focuses more on the most important (nearest to the goal) ones.For example, say you perform A* on a grid in which you can explore following 4 directions (up, down, left, and right). The heuristics would be the Manhattan distance telling the remaining distance from the actual position to the goal. So when this information is combined with the cost of the edge (or weight) it enables A* to be more efficient when exploring nodes."

I know this might be a bit general question and concerning a rather active research field, much beyond my expertise, but I do believe there're some answers.
The use of NN parameters quantization can span from post-training static/dynamic quantization (PTQ) to quantization-aware training (QAT). Generally the target is cutting down FP-32 weights to UINT-8 whilst retaining overall accuracy; the benefits in performance are often sensible, yielding zero to negligible (depending on application) to few percentage drop in accuracy.
However, I hear these statements are true depending on which NN is being quantized (source). Some models indeed are very forgiving, whereas others are not even using more aggressive strategies.

(extracted from PyTorch source)


There're some networks that are very forgiving: you can do PTQ and
the end result is as accurate as the FP value. [...] In some NN
they're slightly more demanding, they're slightly less forgiving on
the approximation [...]

My question are:

Which categories of DNN are more suited for quantization?
What could be one rationale why this would be? Does the size of the network (i.e. number of parameters) has any role, for instance?
What is introducing such demands (this will depend on actual model indeed) in the forward path? Is it to be found in the activation/actual MVP or what?

My guess would be depending on achievable weights sparsity -- however, this in general (AFAIK) can be tuned forcing training constraints, so it wouldn't really answer the question.

Feature Importance for FT Transformer,"
I hope someone is able to shed light on this. I was reading through the codes on this link with regards to getting feature importance from attention scores.
https://github.com/aruberts/TabTransformerTF/blob/main/tabtransformertf/models/fttransformer.py
and I came across these codes.
    # Prepare for Transformer
    transformer_inputs = tf.concat(transformer_inputs, axis=1)
    importances = []
    
    # Pass through Transformer blocks
    for transformer in self.transformers:
        if self.explainable:
            transformer_inputs, att_weights = transformer(transformer_inputs)
            importances.append(tf.reduce_sum(att_weights[:, :, 0, :], axis=1))
        else:
            transformer_inputs = transformer(transformer_inputs)

After cross checking with chatgpt, this is what I found from its replies.
""The third dimension in att_weights[:, :, 0, :] is set to 0 to select the attention weights of the first attention head.""
Basically what I want to ask is whether the syntax make sense since its only appending the first attention head, which may not give the full information on the attention scores or weights. Rather we should be taking all the scores from the attention heads and calculate the mean from there. Is this reasoning correct?
Because I would deem this to be rather straightforward but the author of the github didn't take this approach and hence I wonder what could be the reasons.

So, I had MobileViT as a functional model in TensorFlow and when I trained it on the OCT images I got really good validation losses using the .fit val_split method. After a while I completely shifted to pytorch, got the same model in pytorch. Pytorch I believe has no method as val_split like TF, so I used a library to split the data into 3 dir, the train, val and test each containing 4 classes. But now my val_acc is stuck at 94% and val loss is not decreasing, and it reaches these acc in only 5-6 epochs. What could be the problem?

"In Q-learning, how are Q values updated for the last state in the Q table?","
In Q-learning, I know that the Q-values are updated using the Bellman equation.
$$
Q^{new}(S_t,A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t,A_t) + \alpha [R_{t+1} + \gamma \underset{a}{max} Q(S_{t+1},a) - Q(S_t,A_t)]
$$
However, for the last state in the Q-table, the Q-values cannot be updated using the maximum Q-value of the next state term since the next state itself does not exist.
So how do we updated the Q-values for the last state? In my mind, the logical answer would be to continue using the Bellman equation but equalling the maximum Q-value for the next state term to 0, which results in:
$$
Q^{new}(S_t,A_t) \leftarrow Q(S_t,A_t) + \alpha [R_{t+1} - Q(S_t,A_t)]
$$
","['reinforcement-learning', 'q-learning']","It's just zeroed out (not considered), so $Q(a,s)$ given $s’$ terminal, should just be the expected immediate reward of the last step, thus the update should just be the one you reported (it's also reported in the original paper https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992698 in the end notes, but I'm sure to have red it also in the Sutton and Barto book

"In MAML for RL, are new tasks sampled for every meta update, or is the same set of tasks used throughout?","
Consider Model Agnostic Meta-Learning, as described here.
For a RL task $T_i$, represented with a model $f$, with parameters $\theta$ and learning rate $\alpha$, where the RL loss function is $\mathcal{L}$:
$$
 \theta'_{i} = \theta - \alpha\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_{i}}\left(f_{\theta}\right)
$$
This is standard gradient descent.
The meta-update step samples multiple tasks $\mathcal{T}_i\sim p(\mathcal{T})$, calculates their respective parameters $\theta_i$ from $\theta$, and minimizes the loss of the original $\theta$ with respect to these intermediate $\theta_i$s:
$$
 \min_{\theta} \sum_{\mathcal{T}_{i} \sim p\left(\mathcal{T}\right)} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T_{i}}}\left(f_{\theta'_{i}}\right) = \sum_{\mathcal{T}_{i} \sim p\left(\mathcal{T}\right)} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T_{i}}}\left(f_{\theta - \alpha\nabla_{\theta}\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T}_{i}}\left(f_{\theta}\right)}\right)  \\
 \theta \leftarrow \theta - \beta\nabla_{\theta} \sum_{\mathcal{T}_{i} \sim p\left(\mathcal{T}\right)} \mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{T_{i}}}\left(f_{\theta'_{i}}\right)
$$
Quesstion: is $\mathcal{T}_i\sim p(\mathcal{T})$ sampling done for every meta-update? Or, is a constant set of tasks maintained from the beginning? Can the frequency of task sampling be different from the frequency of meta-updates?

I am doing a Project from an online course so I can not give the material but I got my Project notebook on Github

I want to ask about my understanding about the architecture as well as the data dimension after each layer. Suppose I have a Seq2Seq model as below:

My quesions is that the Input of Encoder is the soure vocabualry size, which mean that each token in the input sequence should be converted into one-hot vector before parsing to the Encoder before hand (for example, should a batch has a dimension of (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size) instead of (batch_size, seq_len)?
I search others notebook and saw that they just parse a batch of (batch_size, seq_len) into the Encoder and I got confused.
Any help is appreciated.
I have tried pass (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size) and the Embedding layer output dimension is (batch_size, seq_len, vocab_size, embedding_dim), which make me more confused, isn't it should be (batch_size, seq_len, embedding_dim)

Is validation data needed with generated training data?,"
I have two systems, a system A that generates some data X and a system B that calculates some Y given an X. System B is comparatively very slow to run on the available hardware. This is why I'm thinking of training a simple neural network to approximate X -> Y.
The question that arose from this is how to create the training, validation, and testing datasets. Since I could generate new training data each epoch using my existing systems, is there even a need for the validation and testing datasets? Are there any benefits to not using new training data each epoch?

Can back-bone of text-to-image GEN AI models utilised for classification?,"
With the advent of GEN AI (Stable Diffusion), we are able to create images with text. For eg. If i need to create a dog on beach during sunset; now in background this model needs to first get images of object in the image which is dog, scene which is beach, sunset.
Now when the model knows what are the objects/ scene in the image, it is good to say it can classify the objects/ scenes. I wanted to utilise this feature of model for building classification models. Would appreciate getting leads/code/discussions on this.

Confusion About Triangle Mask in Transformer Decoder,"
I have some confusion about the implementation of the triangle mask in the transformer decoder. I understand the reasoning for the mask, it prevents the network from 'cheating' by looking ahead at the next token, but the way it's implemented seems strange. First of all, why do we apply the mask to the product $QK^T$? Why not just set the rows representing unseen tokens to zero or some special token before sending the matrix to the transformer? Also, I don't understand the reasoning of a triangle mask in general. Suppose we are training with a sequence of length $\ell_s$, and we are trying to predict token $k$ with $k < \ell_s$. Why don't we have to mask all entries $QK^T_{i,j}$ if $i > k$ or $j > k$? With a standard triangle mask it seems like we still incorporate information computed from 'unseen' tokens.

I'm working on a project to create an AI Quotation tool using the ChatGPT API trained on my data. The data I have spans the last 10 years and is mostly in Excel and PDF format, but it's not consistently structured. Each entry includes customer name, task required, and the price quoted, along with the list price for all tasks we offer.
However, here's the challenge: most companies have specific requirements for the same tasks, resulting in different prices for different companies. The AI needs to identify the company details, match it with the correct task price, and adjust for inflation if necessary. For example, if a company hasn't had a particular task done in 4 years and we've had 3 price increases during that time, the AI should calculate the correct amount for that company considering inflation.
I've done some research, and it seems that results might be inconsistent due to the varying data formats and complexities. I'm curious if anyone has experience with a similar project or has any ideas on whether this is achievable? Any insights, suggestions, or advice on how to approach this would be greatly appreciated! Thank you in advance for your help!

Which situation will helpful using encoder or decoder or both in transformer model?,"
I have some questions about using (encoder / decoder / encoder-decoder) transformer models, included (language) transformer or Vision transformer.
The overall form of a transformer consists of an encoder and a decoder. Depending on the model, you may use only the encoder, only the decoder, or both. However, for what purpose do model designers use only encoders, only decoders, or both?
I already knew that encoders in transformers are as known as taking in a sequence of input data and generates a fixed-length representation of it. This representation can then be fed into the decoder to generate an output sequence.
In other words, the encoder can be thought of as a kind of compression that extracts features from the data. And the decoder can be thought of as playing a role in returning the compressed information in the encoder to its original state.
So I'm wondering why some models work without having both an encoder and a decoder.
Few days ago, I think use only encoders are useful to classifying classes. Because DOSOVITSKIY, Alexey, et al. An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale. arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11929, 2020. paper shows only encoder to classification images. Decoders are useful in generative things, because WANG, Jianfeng, et al. Git: A generative image-to-text transformer for vision and language. arXiv preprint arXiv:2205.14100, 2022. paper using encoder to encode the visual information from the input image into a representation that can be used by the text decoder to generate text. Then, to generate text, they give the 'encoder's output and the text' as the decoder's input.
But, I am sure about that my think are wrong because of BERT and GPT. BERT using encoder and does not have a decoder. GPT uses decoder and does not have a encoder. A typical user thinks that BERT and GPT equally answer the question asked by the user. So they think BERT and GPT provide the same service. However, in terms of model structure, BERT and GPT are completely different.
So, I have two questions about each functional part that makes up the transformer.

what does encoder and decoder do in transformer? The transformer referred to here can be text or image.
For what purpose do model designers use only encoders, only decoders, or both encoders and decoders?

Thank you.

Can I sample finite or infinite images with AutoRegressive Models?,"
I'm learning about AutoRegressive Models used on images, and I've studied the training phase, where you model each pixel on the basis of the previous ones using a certain model architecture.
My question is about generating new images (sampling).
I've seen that the sampling is usually done setting manually the value of the first pixel and calculating the following pixels using the model, i.e. for every pixel you want to generate, you take the previous n pixels and give them to the model which outputs the most likely value, where here ""likely"" is to be intended as the value which is output given the parameters fitted on the training dataset.
But since the model parameters are fixed, and since you set only the first pixel, does this mean that all pixels except the first one are deterministic and hence you can only generate 256 images (256 is the number of possible values of the first pixel in grayscale)?
Thank you!

Implementing an RL agent on a variable action space,"
I've been trying to design and implement a DQN agent as an AI opponent option for a math game I've been working on.
The game is a turn-based grid game, where players alternate making moves and combining numbers to reach a target score. The grid consists of n by n numbers, which can only be used once, whereafter they get replaced by None and can't be selected anymore.
I have a method called get_legal_moves that creates the action space, and the state vector is declared as follows: [player_score, opponent_score, self.target_score, self.grid_size, self.agent_player, self.turns_taken, grid/hashed_state].
The part I'm having trouble with is that the grid is filled with randomly generated numbers, and the action space is constantly changing.
I don't have much experience with ML, so converting the features to tensors and having the agent properly interpret it has been a bit of a problem. All of the elements of the state vector are integers, but the grid is a list of lists of integers, or alternatively, a hashed variation.
I skimmed monte carlo trees and other solutions, but I don't really know where to start. I'd like some advice on how to go about building the agent to begin with. I keep hitting tensor matching errors and problems with the action space getting smaller or larger.

Is there a neural network architecture specialized for mapping lower-to-higher-dimensional data?,"
I am building a neural network that takes in a set of 86 parameters (primarily architecture-related, such as building floor area, kitchen size, number of a certain type of furniture, etc.) and outputs a 4D mulitdimensional array of shape (6, 2532, 39, 5) containing vertices of path data that are meant to output to a CAD file of the building. As of the current moment, I am using the most primitive method to do this: a basic densely-connected neural network with the architecture:
Input(86),
Normalize(),
Dense(64, activation=""relu""),
Dense(128, activation=""relu""),
Dense(128, activation=""relu""),
# required for the reshape
Dense(2962440),
Reshape((6, 2532, 39, 5))

However, this densely-connected neural network produces losses in the trillions, making it hardly viable as a deployable model. This is to be expected - MLPs aren't meant to map lower-dimensional features onto higher-dimensional labels. My ""cheating"" way of making a Dense layer of high enough dimensions to do a reshape isn't truly providing information that the neural network can use to learn. Yet I cannot think of a neural network architecture specialized for low-to-high dimensional training - most architectures are instead specialized for high-to-low dimensional training, like CNNs, which reduce 2D/3D data down to 1D.
Is there any neural network architecture suitable for the task I have outlined?

UPDATE: I found that significant loss reduction could be accomplished by rescaling my train labels to between [0, 1]. However, the model now performs poorly on any input data other than its own training dataset, as the rescaling means that the neural network is highly sensitive to any variation in input data.

How do i approach creating a masked auto-encoder for feature extraction,"
I trained Masked Autoencoder-based models in order to use the encoder as a backbone for another task. Pretraining has been done in a Self-Supervised manner on image data. Now that it comes to my downstream task, I was wondering what is the best way of creating feature maps on the whole image for the 2 models:

ConvNextV2 (fully convolutional masked autoencoder) FCMAE with a mask ratio of 60% in pretraining: Since we deal with sparse convolutions, it might make sense to just set the mask ratio to 0, such that we do not mask out anything and create features for the whole image area, right? I tried to compare it with creating 2 deterministic masks (50% each) and do 2 forward passes such that I can simply add up the feature maps, but the results are not equal. Can someone explain the reason for that?
ViT-MAE (MAE with vision transformer backbone): From my knowledge, Transformers are constrained to their pre-trained sequence length and thus do not perform well when changing the number of input patches (e.g. 100%) for inference to create feature maps for the whole image. Any remarks on that approach?

When should grayscale processing be applied to image inputs in visual reinforcement learning environments?,"
I am currently working with visual environments in Reinforcement Learning (RL) and have noticed differing practices regarding preprocessing of image inputs. Specifically, in the Atari environment, a common approach is to first convert RGB images to grayscale, then stack the frames. The channel number of the final environment observation equals the number of stacked frames.
On the other hand, in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC) environment, the common practice is to directly stack the RGB frames. In this case, the channel number of the final environment observation equals the number of stacked frames times three (corresponding to RGB channels).
Here is a snippet of grayscale processing and frame stacking in the Atari environment:
...
observation = rgb2gray(observation)
observation = stack_frames(observation, stack_size)
...

And here is a snippet of frame stacking in the DMC environment:
...
observation = stack_frames(observation, stack_size)
...

I have two main questions about this:

Why are there different practices for frame stacking in the Atari and DMC environments?
Are there any guiding principles or criteria for deciding when grayscale processing should be applied to the image inputs in different visual environments?

Any insights or recommendations on this matter would be greatly appreciated.

Why do we limit the standard deviation in Actor architectures in Reinforcement Learning?,"
I'm in the process of implementing Actor-Critic structures for Reinforcement Learning (RL) and I've noticed that it's a common practice to limit the standard deviation (std). I've seen this in different implementations, specifically in two types of Actor classes, which I'll refer to as ActorOne (from link) and ActorTwo (from link).
In both implementations, I've observed the restriction of the standard deviation. In ActorOne, the output of a Linear layer is passed through a tanh function to constrain it to the range [-1,1], which is then further transformed to map to a specific range (LOG_SIG_MIN and LOG_SIG_MAX) to get the final log_std. In ActorTwo, the output of a Linear layer is directly clamped to a specific range (LOG_SIG_MIN, LOG_SIG_MAX) to obtain the final log_std.
Here's a snippet from the ActorOne class:
log_std = linear_layer(h)
log_std = torch.tanh(log_std)
log_std = LOG_SIG_MIN + 0.5 * (LOG_SIG_MAX - LOG_SIG_MIN) * (log_std + 1)

And here's a snippet from the ActorTwo class:
log_std = linear_layer(h)
log_std = torch.clamp(log_std, LOG_SIG_MIN, LOG_SIG_MAX)

I have two main questions about this:

What is the purpose of limiting the standard deviation in these implementations? Could there be any practical implications or potential issues if the standard deviation is not limited?

What are the differences between these two methods? From what I understand, in the first approach, the gradient is always preserved, while in the second method, the data that gets processed by Clamp will have its gradient cut off. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each method, and how should I choose between them?

Thus far, AI-written text detection is terribly inaccurate, and if you're a user of r/ChatGPT, you've probably seen myriad ""my teacher accused me of plagiarism"" posts as a result.

Output: was it generated by AI?

How to tell an agent that some actions in the action space are currently not available in gym and the design of action space,"

However, there is a constraint that one task should be served by only one server.How should I design the action space?
So when I design the decision-making action space,I don't know which design is better:

        self.action_space = spaces.MultiDiscrete([M]*N) #action space: [a_1,a_2,...,a_N] N discrete vector, a_n in [0,M-1]

In first way, the variable a_mn stands for if the n-th task  is offloaded to m-th server or not. While in the second way,a_n represents which server should be chosen by the n-th task.
If the first way is better, how can I implement the constraints mentioned before, since there is lots of infeasible actions in the action space?
And I was confused in both situation if it is possible to use the DQN to produce the Q value of all action from this action space?

Why is my DQN agent not converging to a constant reward?,"
I'm currently training a DQN agent. I use an epsilon greedy exploration strategy where I decay the epsilon value linearly until it reaches 0 over 300 episodes. For the rest of the remaining 50 episodes, epsilon is always 0. Since the value is 0, I thought that the agent would always select the same actions throughout the training but that does not seem to happen since the reward of the last 50 episodes is not exactly the same as can be seen by the graph below. The blue graph is a plot of the reward for each episode and the orange one is the average reward of the last 100 episodes.

Is increasing the number of episodes after epsilon reaches 0 a correct solution for this? I have not tried this as each episode takes approximately 20 seconds to complete, so the training can become really long. Thanks in advance!
","['dqn', 'epsilon-greedy-policy']","Annealing $\epsilon$ to 0 in $\epsilon$-greedy DQN is intended to reduce the exploration capability of the DQN agent, but it does not prevent the DQN agent from continuing to learn. Typically, DQN incorporates a replay buffer that stores previous experience tuples of the form $(\mbox{state},\ \mbox{action},\ \mbox{reward},\ \mbox{next state})$. The DQN agent is still able to store new experience tuples and learn from all stored experience tuples when $\epsilon=0$. As the agent continues to learn, its policy may change, and even a slight change in policy may alter its choice of actions - this phenomenon appears to be what your graph is displaying.To answer your question, most deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms have numerous moving parts, and from what I've read in the literature, convergence to a fixed policy over consecutive episodes has not traditionally been a goal when training DRL algorithms. I personally would say that your chart shows fantastic results, as it exhibits great stability with negligible fluctuations in the reward graph when $\epsilon=0$. If you are absolutely determined to reach a fixed policy or reward graph during training, it would be helpful to know the specifics of the underlying environment, possibly by asking another question on this site with all of the details."
how to train virtex automl to recognise 7 segment display numbers,"
We're working on a project which needs to read seven segment displays from photos.  We've tried a few AI text recognisers but the 'font' is too tricky.  So we thought given that we're looking for a small number of quite distinct shapes AutoML would be worth a go.
We've not done this before so we had a go and our first model is a bit disappointing, and we've not found anywhere which gives good advice on training data.  We don't have a big collection of photos of seven segment displays we can use (let alone a labelled one)
We made 13000 images of single digits (0-9 as well as C and F).  We used a 7 segment font to get the general shape then rendered it on to a flat colour background in random colour combiations, at random locations in the image and with random amounts of skew (using a perspective transform)
this gives pretty random results when tested against photos, it works ok if we generate more images in the same way as we made training data and test against them

is skewing neccessary/useful? or does AutoML account for skew/rotation etc
is a flat background a basic no-no?  should we be putting random photos in the background?  If so where can one get a collection of thousands of random photos or backgrounds to use?
is colour important - we don't care about colour of the digits, in fact we want any colour combination to be recognised.  We've used random foreground/background colour combinations to 'tell' the model this, is this necessary?
I've seen other training data that is entirely in greyscale - e.g. mikegchambers on youtube and his lego brick recogniser-  will people using greyscale training data be converting the image to greyscale before sending it to the model

How to overcome symmetry in the solution space when learning a simple neural network?,"
What are good solution recipes to overcome the problem that in neural network learning, when the solution space has symmetries, learning may eventually stall due to the sum of the gradients over the network inputs converging to a tiny sum even though the individual gradients for each input to the network separately stay relatively big?
As a simple example, consider a neural network with a two-dimensional input and a singly dimensional output with a fully connected first layer, and a MaxPool layer as the second layer. We want the network to learn the function $\max(x+2y,3x+y)$ for network input tuples $(x,y)$. For this function, two different suitable weight matrices for the linear layer exist as the order of the input values to the MaxPool layer does not matter.
With a standard Adam optimizer, learning sometimes stalls before the MSE is very close to $0$. Small variations in the setting can cause learning to succeed, such as using a linear layer without a bias function or different random seeds. However, perhaps there are some commonly used approaches to solve such symmetry problems in a more systematic way?
The following example code in PyTorch exemplifies the problem:
import torch
import numpy
from livelossplot import PlotLosses

# Generate data to learn from
numpy.random.seed(42)
torch.manual_seed(123)
num_samples = 1000
X = torch.rand(num_samples, 2)
Y = torch.max(torch.cat((X[:,0:1]+2*X[:,1:2],3*X[:,0:1]+X[:,1:2]),dim=1),dim=1,keepdim=True)[0]

network = torch.nn.Sequential(
  torch.nn.Linear(X.shape[1],2,bias=True),
  torch.nn.MaxPool1d(2,1)
)

liveloss = PlotLosses()
opt = torch.optim.Adam(network.parameters(), lr=0.02)
lossfn = lambda x,y: ((x-y)**2).mean()

for i in range(4000):
  opt.zero_grad()
  out = network(X)
  l = lossfn(Y,out)    
  current_loss = l.item()
  (l).backward()               
  opt.step()

  logs = {}
  logs[""err""] = torch.mean(torch.abs(Y - out)).item()
  liveloss.update(logs)
  liveloss.draw()

The values of the loss function over time (MSE) look as follows:

The final MSE is about 0.106. It can be verified that indeed the function to learn has a perfect representation in this network shape by initializing the weight matrix by hand:
with torch.no_grad():
    network[0].weight[0, 0] = 1
    network[0].weight[0, 1] = 2
    network[0].weight[1, 0] = 3
    network[0].weight[1, 1] = 1
    network[0].bias[0] = 0    
    network[0].bias[1] = 0    

When doing so before the learning process, the MSE starts with 0 and stays 0.
To provide some context for why this problem is interesting, the above example is just exemplifying a problem that occurs in a different context, namely encoding domain knowledge in a neural network with a structure adapted to this knowledge shape and then using neural network learning to fine-tune the model. The domain knowledge encoding may induce many such symmetries in the solution space, and hence just wiggling some aspects of the network or the learning process in an unsystematic way is unlikely to enforce learning across all such symmetries at the same time.

Edit with additional experiments based on comments.

With a learning rate of 0.02 and without dropout and L2-regularization, the MSE plateaus at a MSE of 0.106 after ~10 epochs
With a learning rate of 0.02 with dropout of 0.05 before the first (linear) layer and without L2-regularization, the MSE jumps between ~0.2 and ~0.25 after ~10 epochs
With a learning rate of 0.02 with dropout of 0.05 after the first (linear) layer and without L2-regularization, the MSE jumps between ~0.17 and ~0.21 after ~10 epochs

In all cases, the learned model doesn't look anywhere close to the perfect model with the linear layer weight matrix $\left(\begin{matrix}1 & 2 \\ 3 & 1 \end{matrix}\right)$ and the perfect bias vector $(0,0)^T$ (for the data set).

When I label samples from each class using 0 and 1, I select a sigmoid output in the last layer of the CNN, like
 x = Dense(1, activation=""sigmoid"")(x)

Then, I set up a series of metrics to follow training progress, as in
metrics = [
  keras.metrics.TruePositives(name='tp'),
  keras.metrics.FalsePositives(name='fp'),
  keras.metrics.TrueNegatives(name='tn'),
  keras.metrics.FalseNegatives(name='fn'), 
  keras.metrics.BinaryAccuracy(name='accuracy'),
  keras.metrics.Precision(name='precision'),
  keras.metrics.Recall(name='recall'),
  keras.metrics.AUC(name='auc'),
  keras.metrics.AUC(name='prc', curve='PR'), # precision-recall curve]

Finally, my model is compiled and fit using binary crossentropy loss:
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=metrics)
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
                         batch_size=batch_size, epochs=number_of_epochs, 
                         verbose=verbosity_mode,
                         validation_data = (X_val, y_val),
                         callbacks=[es, cc])

Everything works fine, as I can see the metrics both for my training and my validation set changing during training:
Epoch 58/60
132/132 - 24s - loss: 0.0205 - tp: 2413.0000 - fp: 9.0000 - tn: 1770.0000 - fn: 7.0000 - accuracy: 0.9962 - precision: 0.9963 - recall: 0.9971 - auc: 0.9999 - prc: 0.9999 - val_loss: 0.3301 - val_tp: 1402.0000 - val_fp: 182.0000 - val_tn: 2039.0000 - val_fn: 178.0000 - val_accuracy: 0.9053 - val_precision: 0.8851 - val_recall: 0.8873 - val_auc: 0.9607 - val_prc: 0.9426 - 24s/epoch - 180ms/step
Epoch 59/60
132/132 - 25s - loss: 0.0217 - tp: 2408.0000 - fp: 11.0000 - tn: 1768.0000 - fn: 12.0000 - accuracy: 0.9945 - precision: 0.9955 - recall: 0.9950 - auc: 0.9999 - prc: 0.9999 - val_loss: 0.3722 - val_tp: 1472.0000 - val_fp: 296.0000 - val_tn: 1925.0000 - val_fn: 108.0000 - val_accuracy: 0.8937 - val_precision: 0.8326 - val_recall: 0.9316 - val_auc: 0.9586 - val_prc: 0.9313 - 25s/epoch - 191ms/step

Now, if my labels are one-hot encoded, a softmax activation is used in the last layer for two classes and categorical crossentropy should be selected in model compilation:
x = Dense(2, activation=""softmax"")(x)
...
# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=metrics)
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, 
                         batch_size=batch_size, epochs=number_of_epochs, 
                         verbose=verbosity_mode,
                         validation_data = (X_val, y_val),
                         callbacks=[es, cc])

But then my metrics are shown in a different way:
Epoch 59/60
132/132 - 25s - loss: 0.0217 - tp: 2408.0000 - fp: 11.0000 - tn: 2408.0000 - fn: 11.0000 - accuracy: 0.9945 - precision: 0.9945 - recall: 0.9945 - auc: 0.9999 - prc: 0.9999 - val_loss: 0.3722 - val_tp: 1472.0000 - val_fp: 296.0000 - val_tn: 1472.0000 - val_fn: 296.0000 - val_accuracy: 0.8937 - val_precision: 0.8937 - val_recall: 0.8937 - val_auc: 0.9586 - val_prc: 0.9313 - 25s/epoch - 191ms/step

It seems that true positives equal true negatives, and false positives equal false negatives, that is, all the metrics are strangely shown.
Does anyone know a solution to this? That is, a way to see metrics during training in the latter setup (one-hot, softmax, categorical crossentropy) as shown in the former setup (int, sigmoid, binary crossentropy).
Thank you!

Analysis of the output samples from an autoencoder,"
I am conducting some experiments on an autoencoder as part of my research project. For our first experiment, we have a feedforward neural network (using pytorch), which is being given an input of dimensions $80 \times 1$ and is giving out an output of dimensions $80 \times 1$. The $80$ input random variables are jointly gaussian. The input samples are being generated from a randomly generated block diagonal covariance matrix of size $80 \times 80$ and $0$ mean vector $80 \times 1$.
So first, we are training the autoencoder on some randomly generated samples from this input distribution using mean squared error as the loss function (we are sending the input column by column) and then we plan to train it on KL divergence. After that we will give it some inputs, get the output and analyze the output distribution with respect to the input distribution.
The problem we are facing is as follows:

During the training, the covariance matrix of the output distribution is sometimes of rank < 80 and we are getting an error stating that the covariance matrix is not positive definite. We are using torch.cov() to generate the covariance matrix

What would be the best way to calculate KL divergence in this particular context? We need to use it as a loss function.


This is the code we are using for it right now:
loss = torch.distributions.kl.kl_divergence
(
 torch.distributions.MultivariateNormal(mu1_tensor, cov1_tensor),
 torch.distributions.MultivariateNormal(mu2, cov2)`
 )

Here is another function that we have come across for it.
kl_loss = torch.nn.functional.kl_div(output_tensor.log(), input_tensor, reduction='batchmean')

"Why in Multi-Head Attention implementation should we use $3$ linear layers for Q, K, V instead of $3 * h$ layers?","
I have been trying to implement a Transformer architecture using PyTorch by following the Attention Is All You Need paper as well as the The Annotated Transformer blog post to compare my code with theirs. And I noticed that in their implementation of the Multi-Head Attention they have used three nn.Linear(d_model, d_model) to project the input of the encoder before splitting these projections into (n_heads, d_k) matrices for the attention. But as my understanding of the paper goes, we need to have n_heads of nn.Linear(d_model, d_k) for each of the queries, keys and values as we can see in the Multi-Head Attention's diagram here from the paper:

We clearly see as many nn.Linear layers as there are of heads. As well as the explanation of the authors:

Each $head_{i}$ uses $W_{i}^{Q}$, $W_{i}^{K}$ and $W_{i}^{V}$. So in my implementation I did this:
class MultiHeadedAttention(nn.Module):
  def __init__(self, d_model=512, h=8):
    super(MultiHeadedAttention, self).__init__()
    self.d_model = d_model
    self.h = h
    self.d_k = d_model // h
    self.query_linears = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(d_model, self.d_k) for i in range(h)])
    self.key_linears = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(d_model, self.d_k) for i in range(h)])
    self.value_linears = nn.ModuleList([nn.Linear(d_model, self.d_k) for i in range(h)])
    self.projection_layer = nn.Linear(h * self.d_k, d_model)

  def forward(self, Q, K, V, mask=None):
    batch_size = Q.size(0)
    queries = torch.cat([linear(Q).view(batch_size, 1, -1, self.d_k) for linear in self.query_linears], dim=1)
    keys = torch.cat([linear(K).view(batch_size, 1, -1, self.d_k) for linear in self.key_linears], dim=1)
    values = torch.cat([linear(V).view(batch_size, 1, -1, self.d_k) for linear in self.value_linears], dim=1)

    x = scaled_dot_product_attention(queries, keys, values, mask)

    x = x.transpose(1, 2)
    x = x.contiguous()
    x = x.view(batch_size, -1, self.h * self.d_k)
    x = self.projection_layer(x)
    return x

But I'm surely missing a key piece of understanding. And I'd be really grateful if someone can point it out to me.
Thank you.
","['transformer', 'pytorch', 'attention', 'implementation', 'dense-layers']","It is just an optimization technique.If you have a vector $x$ of size $d$ and you want to multiply with $n$ different matrices $W_i$ of shape $d \times d_k$, then you could simply stack these matrices along the last dimension and perform a single matrix multiplication.A block view of this matrix operation would look like this:\begin{equation}
  x
  \underbrace{
    \begin{bmatrix}
      W_0 & W_1 & \cdots & W_{n-1}
    \end{bmatrix}
  }_{\text{stack along the last dim}}
  =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    xW_0 & xW_1 & \cdots & xW_{n-1}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}Now instead of looping over all the matrices, you actually perform the forward pass with a single vector-matrix multiplication $xW$, where $W$ has shape $d \times nd_k$.Another thing that the authors of the paper this is that they chose $n$ and $d_k$ such that $d = nd_k$. So if $d=512$ and you want to have 8 heads in the multi-head attention layer, then you set $d_k=64$. This was done so that no matter how many heads you chose to have, you always have the same number of parameters in the model. I guess it is easier to do hyperparameter search this way, but you don't have to do it if you don't want to.If you want to see a more detailed blog post about the implementation details of the transformer model feel free to check out this: https://pi-tau.github.io/posts/transformer/"
Stable Diffusion: Is it possible to merge specific token weights from one model into another?,"
I have three models: A, B, C
I merged A+C and B+C together.
A+C gives me great results for certain things but is not so good with specific other things. B+C is great with things that A+C is not, but performs less great in other areas.
I was wondering if there is a way to merge specific types of tokens from A+C into B+C so that it performs better with these things.
I read about token merging, but it seems to be something else (about performance).
Is there a way to achieve that only specific things get merged from one model into another?

I'm using BLIP (https://github.com/salesforce/BLIP), a multimodal model that describes a picture as it is.
I expect to record information about the photo and match the closest one in the database. I will record the image raw data as well as the preprocessed data in the database after each new input of a photo, along with the descriptive information after reasoning through BLIP.
My goal is to match the image to the closest one, and when it exceeds a certain level of similarity I will not inference and just use the description information in the database.
Here is my original question:
When a picture is entered, how to match the closest one from the database.
But now I'm wondering if I using text similarity (description) will be more easier? But I don't know if it will loss some detail? So I want to try both.
I want the process to be as accurate and fast as possible, and if it's not fast enough, then there's no point in doing it, since Inferring a photo on computer takes less than 0.5s.
Considering that there won't be a lot of images recorded in the database, I'm guessing there will only be an order of magnitude of 100 photos.
If it's a text similarity analysis, is there a recommended algorithm for that, considering I need to traverse the database?
Many thanks for seeing someone reply, this is my first time using this site.

I wonder why it is better than A/B testing ? We can simply perform A/B testing between the variants of any product and can calculate the Interaction Rate, and can choose which one of the variant is better.

What is the difference between A/B testing and Reinforcement Learning?

Model-based learning in continuous state and action spaces,"
I am interested in learning how transition probabilities/mdps are constructed in continuous state and action space model-based learning setting. There is some literature available on this matter, but they do not explicitly construct the model to simulate the environment, through policy gradient.
The closest literature that builds a model that I found is on continuous state space and finite action space, which is slightly different than what I aim to do. Furthermore even in this case the main problem that I face is, transition probability is assumed to give you the probability of obtaning next state, which does not necessarily have to be non-zero for instance when the transition probability is non-atomic transition probability.
I will appreciate if someone atleast points me relevant literature in this direction.

My friend says that genAI would become more human like, and perhaps even smarter than humans if it were simply trained on more and more data. I say that this would overtrain the models, and we would perhaps lose the generative aspect.

How can a Regression based Neural Network learn class thresholds?,"
I understand that to solve multilabel classification problems, we can use the softmax activation function in the output layer of the neural network. The softmax function outputs probabilities of each label, and the label with highest probability is then predicted as the target label.
However, I just saw in a research paper that the authors used regression function instead of softmax function, in output layer. The paper says:

Because regression classification can automatically adjust
classification thresholds based on data distribution to maximize classification performance

I do not understand how can the model learn classification thresholds by itself?
Are these thresholds part of the neural network architecture? Are these thresholds trained like weights of layers?

","['neural-networks', 'regression', 'sigmoid', 'multiclass-classification']","First thing to notice, is that the assumptions on the target don't match the ones of multi-classifications: in particular, in multi-class classification, it's generally assumed that any other class outside the target one, is equally bad.Instead here, it's clear that this is not true:
Given an input with target ""Healty Apple"", predicting ""General Apple Scab"" is not as bad as predicting ""Serious Cedar Apple Rust""... in other words, the class order counts.In order to capture this property, they decide to use classification regression.About the automatic threshold, they don't say anything about it on the paper, so in my opinion what they do is to adjust them to improve performance.On top of my head, one way is by predicting the regression score for the training set, and then fitting 6 Gaussian distributions (like a naive Bayes model), and adjusting the threshold by moving them so that they best fit the result.... or you can just plot them with different colors and check where the colors lies"
Methods for sequential decision optimization problem with nonlinear bayesian reward function,"
I am attempting to grasp if there are any other methods out there that i am not aware of that can be beneficial given my problem context.
Being inspired from optimal experimental design communities and RL-communities i have a sense there is.
To illustrate the problem at hand, consider a multivariate Bayesian regression model represented as $\hat{y}_t = b_{1, t} \cdot x_{1,t}^{c_1} + b_{2, t} \cdot x_{2,t}^{c_2}$ where as $\hat{y}_t$ denotes predicted values and $y_t$ observations. The purpose of this model is to estimate rewards $\hat{y}_t$ based on inputs ($x_{1,t}$, $x_{2,t}$) at each time step denoted by $t$. The parameters $b_{1, t}$ and $b_{2, t}$ are time-variant implying that they may vary over the horizon and are not constant. For instance, we could consider a Gaussian random walk prior that associates with the day of the month, allowing it to capture and generalize the day-of-the-month effect observed across multiple months (assume we have daily historical data). $c_1$ and $c_2$ follow a gamma distribution. Lets assume a normally distributed likelihood $L(y_t|b_1, b_2, c_1, c_2, x_{1, t}, x_{2, t}) \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{y_t}, \sigma^2)$. I aim to plan inputs over a given horizon $H$ given a specified budget $\left(\sum_{t \in H} x_{1,t} + x_{2,t} \le \mbox{budget}\right)$, with the main objective of maximizing cumulative rewards. To help with this goal, it is important to also gain knowledge about the model parameters to facilitate improved allocation of inputs for maximizing cumulative rewards in the future.
Every day we make a decision on how to allocate a portion of the total budget and every day we receive a response ($y_t=\mbox{sales} \; timestep \; t$).
Note that every day, we have the ability to adjust our planning in accordance with the newly acquired information. As a result, we can recompute our decisions daily and implement them, essentially enabling us to recompute our decisions ""online"".
Typically, we have access to 30-300 daily data points to establish the initial posterior, and the planning horizon is typically 30 days.
I am aware of essentially two, maybe three different strategies of ""solving"" this problem.
Consider the following algorithm showcasing these different strategies:

Estimate the posterior with e.g MCMC factoring in our current dataset

Sample from the posterior

Strategy 1: Sample a single set of parameters from the posterior(thompson sampling)
Strategy 2: Sample many samples from the posterior(SAA)
Strategy 3: Sample many samples from the posterior or with some probability $\epsilon$ maximize information gain(see bulletpoint 3 for clarification)


Construct a deterministic optimization problem over the whole horizon with the previously sampled parameters

Strategy 1: Objective function being $\sum_{t \in H}\hat{y}_t$ with the single sample as parameters
Strategy 2: Objective function being $\sum_{t \in H}\frac{1}{M}\sum_M \hat{y}_t$ where $M$ denotes the quantity of samples
Strategy 3: Determine the timesteps that should maximize information gain by sampling from a binomial distributon governed by $\epsilon, H$ and maximize expected information gain at those timesteps and then insert those values as constants in objective function for Strategy 2


Solve the determinstic optimization problem subject to the budget constraint

Set allocation for today

Retrieve reward

Add allocation and reward to current dataset

Iterate from 1 the next day
Notice how the decisions we made for days in the future stemming from solving the optimization problem are merely generated such that we take a better decision today, given that the coefficients are time-varying we might want to ease in on money today to spend more tomorrow e.g. Also, it helps us adapt to the budget constraint over the whole horizon.


One might hypothesize that Strategy 1 would yield the most unstable controller/agent and consequently result in the highest level of exploration.
Likewise, one would suspect that Strategy 2 would lead to the most stable controller/agent, favoring a higher degree of exploitation. The balance between exploration and exploitation is determined by the number of samples we choose to take. Notably, in the extreme case of just one sample, we revert to Strategy 1.
Additionally, one would expect Strategy 3 to represent a blend of the two other strategies, with the parameter $\epsilon$ governing the level of exploration.
A concern regarding all of these approaches is the omission of consideration for how our decisions might influence our future belief states and, consequently, subsequent decisions. The proposed exploration techniques seems to me somewhat adhoc.

While researching optimal experimental design, a community that addresses similar problems to mine, and model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning, I sense that there may exist further strategies, some of which possess theoretical guarantees of optimality, even if their practical implementation is challenging/impossible.
Upon reading about optimal experimental design and comparing Batch OED and Sequential OED, I notice the underlying assumption that we cannot recompute our decisions or policies online(as is the case for me), check e.g this great thesis: Numerical approaches for sequential Bayesian optimal experimental design.
Batch OED computes all decisions over the entire horizon in a single shot, making it unable to adjust to changing states (belief states).
On the other hand, Sequential OED calculates policies for decisions that are dependent on the state, thus allowing it to adapt to changing states (belief states).
However, in my scenario, I have the freedom to recompute decisions or policies at each timestep(or experiment in the context of OED). Clearly, you could just recompute a batch OED or sequential OED strategy at each time step. Methods from these communities may potentially provide better solutions than the ones proposed. However, I find it challenging to see how some of the batch and sequential OED solutions would be superior to the ones proposed given the context and the fact that we can recompute every timestep. Nevertheless, it seems easier to include the budget constraint in batch OED strategies.
Furthermore, while studying Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning, I encountered the Bayes optimal policy theorem, which theoretically guarantees optimality in the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, see page 45: Bayesian Reinforcement Learning: A Survey. However, I find it challenging to see how I can adapt my problem to fit such a setting and solve it approximately.
Consequently, this leads to my question:

Question: Considering the context, are there any other methods beyond the ones I proposed in the algorithm that could be superior and that can be employed to address this problem? If so, how would I proceed with implementing them?

Can LLMs be used to discover new laws of logic?,"
Can LLMs be used to discover new laws of logic?
Stephen Wolfram seems to claim this in What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work?, § ""What Really Lets ChatGPT Work?"":

is there a general way to tell if a sentence is meaningful? There’s no traditional overall theory for that. But it’s something that one can think of ChatGPT as having implicitly “developed a theory for” after being trained with billions of (presumably meaningful) sentences from the web, etc.
What might this theory be like? Well, there’s one tiny corner that’s basically been known for two millennia, and that’s logic. And certainly in the syllogistic form in which Aristotle discovered it, logic is basically a way of saying that sentences that follow certain patterns are reasonable, while others are not. Thus, for example, it’s reasonable to say “All X are Y. This is not Y, so it’s not an X” (as in “All fishes are blue. This is not blue, so it’s not a fish.”). And just as one can somewhat whimsically imagine that Aristotle discovered syllogistic logic by going (“machine-learning-style”) through lots of examples of rhetoric, so too one can imagine that in the training of ChatGPT it will have been able to “discover syllogistic logic” by looking at lots of text on the web, etc. (And, yes, while one can therefore expect ChatGPT to produce text that contains “correct inferences” based on things like syllogistic logic, it’s a quite different story when it comes to more sophisticated formal logic—and I think one can expect it to fail here for the same kind of reasons it fails in parenthesis matching.)

how to approach this problem (open set classification of diverse folder of images),"
suppose we are presented with a folder of images. the task is just detect if any new image should belong in this folder or not.
in this folder, there may be natural groups of images that are similar to each other, but the groups themselves are very different from each other and is probably ineffective to be generalized under one class.
for example maybe we have images of sports cars, then images of dogs. The images in the folder are not divided in any way. there are no labels for any of these images. except that whatever is in the folder is what we want to look for from new images.
how do we approach this problem in the most efficient and effective way?
one approach i thought of was perhaps train a deep clustering model, and also separately train a few shot open set recognition model. divide the folder into N classes, then take K samples from each of the classes in the folder and check if a new image should belong to any of these. having multiple steps like this using separately trained models may accumulate too much error in the end. any other suggestions?

Model architecture object detection where entire image context and nearby objects are important to accurate prediction,"
I'm working on a model to classify multiple extremely similar looking objects in a single image. A simple object detection model works ok but the issue is that I'm classifying similar looking object from aerial imagery. Think houses in a neighborhood that you want to match to an address. So the way a person would classify would be to pull up a satellite image and use it as a reference and learn the spatial relationships between the various houses to label them. I'm wondering if there are better models out there that will take the entire image context and the spatial relationships of the objects in the image in account when making a prediction. I can easily create an object detection model to classify the universe of objects (houses) first and then do a custom image classification model second. I was considering an approach like this: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1812/1812.00291.pdf

How can i cast this problem as an POMDP or an BAMDP?,"
I am currently attempting to formulate my problem as either a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) or a Bayesian Adaptive Markov Decision Process (BAMDP). My end goal is to gain insights into the proposed methods within this domain and understand how researchers approximate the Bayes optimal policy, which offers theoretical guarantees of achieving an optimal exploration-exploitation tradeoff.
To illustrate the problem at hand, consider a multivariate Bayesian regression model represented as $\hat{y}_t = b_1 \cdot x_{1,t}^{c_1} + b_2 \cdot x_{2,t}^{c_2}$ where as $\hat{y}_t$ denotes predicted values. The purpose of this model is to estimate rewards $\hat{y}_t$ based on inputs ($x_{1,t}$, $x_{2,t}$) at each time step denoted by $t$. The parameters $b_1$ and $b_2$ are assumed to follow a half-normal distribution, while $c_1$ and $c_2$ follow a gamma distribution. Lets assume a normally distributed likelihood $L(y_t|b_1, b_2, c_1, c_2, x_{1, t}, x_{2, t}) \sim \mathcal{N}(\hat{y_t}, \sigma^2)$ where as $y_t$ denotes observations. I aim to plan inputs over a given horizon $H$ given a specified budget $\left(\sum_t x_{1,t} + x_{2,t} \le \mbox{budget}\right)$, with the main objective of maximizing cumulative rewards. To help with this goal, it is important to also gain knowledge about the model parameters to facilitate improved allocation of inputs for maximizing cumulative rewards in the future.
Every day we make a decision on how to allocate a portion of the total budget and every day we receive a response ($y=\mbox{sales}$). Typically, we have access to 30-300 daily data points to establish the initial posterior, and the planning horizon is typically 30 days. Notice that we every day can adjust our planning in accordance with the newly retrieved information.

To cast this problem as an BAMDP(extension of an POMDP) we need the following tuple $<S', A, P', P_{0}^{'}, R'>$:
where as:

$S'$ is the set of hyper-states, S x $\phi$

$A$ is the set of actions

$P'(.|s, \phi, a)$ is the transition function between hyperstates, conditioned on action
$a$ being taken in hyperspace $(s, \phi)$

$P_{0}^{'} \in P(S\;  X \; \phi)$ combines initial distribution over physical states,
and prior distributions over transition functions $\phi_{0}$

$R'(.|s, \phi, a) = R(s, a)$ represents the reward obtained when action $a$ is taken in
state $s$


following the survey: ""Bayesian Reinforcement Learning: A Survey"" which can be found here ""https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04436.pdf""

My attempt to construct a BAMDP (in this instance, excluding any attempt to account for the budget constraint) can be described as follows:

$S'$ being the currently observed value, denoted as $y_{t}$. Current history of dataponts, lets denote it as $I = (x_{1, 1}, x_{2, 1}, y_1, ......, x_{1, t-1}, x_{2, t-1}, y_{t-1})$ or we could represent it purely as our beliefs(thus posteriors)?
$A$ being the set of actions, in this case continuous for both investment alternatives and over the whole horizon thus: $\mathcal{A} = \{(x_t, x2_t) \mid x_t > 0, x2_t > 0, for \; t = 1, 2, \ldots, H\}$
$P'(.|s, \phi, a)$ being the expected value of the likelihood function given the current belief state and an action as well as the concatenation of datapoints into our historical dataset?
$P_{0}^{'} \in P(S\;  X \; \phi)$ Is our current belief state prior to rolling on our algorithm, thus our posteriors we obtain from our historical data?
$R'(.|s, \phi, a) = R(s, a)$ being $\sum_t b_1 \cdot x_{1,t}^{c_1} + b_2 \cdot x_{2,t}^{c_2}$ or $\sum_t y_t$ ?

As you can see, i have issues casting this as an BAMDP or as an POMDP.

Question: How can I frame this problem as a Belief-Action-MDP (BAMDP) or a Partially Observable MDP (POMDP)?

Train/Validation/Test split in Zero-Shot learning?,"
Is it recommended to do test/validation epochs in zero shot learning tasks? how can one split the unseen and seen classes in that case?
Can the validation set be a mixture of the two, under the assumption that we do not update the weights in validation steps?
If so, how can it help? would it be OK to use such thing to (for instance) observe overfitting and to stop the training process at a different phase?
",['zero-shot-learning'],"Zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a type of machine learning where the model needs to correctly identify or classify objects from classes it has never seen during training. The standard way to evaluate ZSL is to have a strict separation between seen classes (those the model is trained on) and unseen classes (those the model is tested on).Given this, the idea of a 'validation set' in the traditional sense, where you use part of your training data to tune hyperparameters or stop training to prevent overfitting, doesn't exactly apply in the same way. Here's why:Seen classes: The model is trained on these classes. You can certainly split this data into a training set and a validation set for the purpose of tuning hyperparameters, checking for overfitting, and deciding when to stop training. This is no different from standard machine learning practice.Unseen classes: These are held out entirely during training. The model doesn't see any examples from these classes until it's time to evaluate its zero-shot learning performance.In zero-shot learning, the key evaluation is how well the model performs on the unseen classes. You wouldn't typically use these unseen classes for validation during training because that would violate the principle of zero-shot learning — the model is not supposed to have seen any examples of these classes before test time.Also, mixing seen and unseen classes in a validation set can be misleading. If the model is performing well on the seen classes but poorly on the unseen classes, the average performance might still look acceptable, even though the model is not achieving the goal of zero-shot learning.To observe overfitting, stop the training process, or tune hyperparameters, it is common to split the seen classes into a training set and a validation set. You can then evaluate the performance of the model on the unseen classes after training.Remember that the ultimate goal of zero-shot learning is to generalize well to unseen classes. Therefore, the performance metric should reflect that goal. For example, you might measure the accuracy of the model on the unseen classes, or use a more sophisticated measure such as the harmonic mean of the accuracy on seen and unseen classes (known as the H-score)."
Which algorithm for production scheduling with multiple goals - alternative for genetic algorithm,"
I am currently using a genetic algorithm for optimising the production schedules of a factory that produces bespoke insulation panels.
The factory has a list of bespoke panels that need to be produced in the most optimised way.
The panels have:

a thickness (10 sizes)
type of material (20 types)
unique width and length
angle left/right (not all panels are 90 degrees)

The panels are produced on tables. There are max 2 panels per table (they most both fit on the table (combined with of the panels must be smaller than the width of the table).
It is best to combine panels with the same thickness and type of material. This saves a lot of manual work. If 2 panels with (almost) the same angle can be combined on a table, only one manual action needs to be done by a worker.
We are currently using a genetic algorithm to calculate the best combinations in the given list.
The fitness is calculated by using the thickness, material type, angle (and sum of panel width < table width)
Are there other types of algorithms/AI that can be used and would be much less resource intensive? How could we approach these?

Can we naively merge source and target datasets to train for the same task instead of performing domain adaptation?,"
I have seen from literature that models such as DANN or ADDA are typical in the field of Domain Adaptation, a branch of transductive learning. I know that these methods are extremely useful especially when we try to perform the same tasks as for source on the unlabelled targets.
One question that rises to my mind is if we have target and source domains both with labels, other than doing adaptation, is it possible that we naively merge the two dataset and perform the normal supervised learning setup?
My first thought was that DANN's purpose lies on trying to extract a somewhat universal feature that can generalize over the whole scope of domain. If we just naively merge the dataset, the model might be able to classify the data's originating domain to perform the specified task. In other words, it can internally classify the domain and source looking at the feature vector and do a prediction.
However suppose we have an MNIST and USPS dataset being the source and target domain. We can make a DANN network to make a generalized feature vector, which indeed seems logically convincing. But after all, our goal of classifying between the number labels is based on the qualitative assessment of features derived from the image. How can we really tell that classifying one's domain and then performing their task is something different from the methodology just stated. Then why bother performing adversarial training?
I am definitely new to this field, so I may have a lot of non-standard terminology or some errors in my reasoning. Thank you very much in advance.

I have a collection of 700 categories, all potential classifications for articles. My current need is to create a system that can dynamically categorize short texts or articles according to these 700 categories.
I've been experimenting with a rudimentary approach using chatGPT to read the categories from a PDF via a plugin. The process is quite straightforward - I input the title and the first two lines of an article, and chatGPT does a fairly decent job of predicting the most fitting category.
The downside? I'm concerned about its scalability and economic viability. The current method might not work so well when we're talking about classifying a significant number of articles.
My question to you, my fellow AI enthusiasts: How would you approach designing a system, via an API, capable of doing this quickly and on a large scale?
Is there a feature that allows the Language Learning Model (LLM) to retain the list of 700 categories in its memory so that I don't have to pass it every time? I'm aware that the billing structure is token-based, so it would be ideal to submit the categories once (or as few times as possible) and then pose a simple query like:

""Categorize this article based on the categories I previously gave you. Article title: 'Barbie vs Oppenheimer: Which Movie Will Garner Greater Success?'""

Ideally, I'd want this system to be persistently active and capable of processing countless queries over an extended period, say a month or a year.
So, any ideas on how to design such a system? There are undoubtedly numerous routes to take. I'm really just seeking some initial direction so that I can dive deeper into research on my own.

I tried Google Bard now recently for the first time after we got into here in Finland too. And to my surprise it gives different answer each time I ask the same question. Is this a feature of LLM or Bard or what takes?
",['chatgpt'],"LLMs generate probability density over the vocabulary of tokens that can be generated, i.e. for a given input text, they output a set of probabilities corresponding to each token in the vocabulary. The higher probability means that the LLM predicts it to be a more reliable next token than the lower probability ones. For example, given the input text, She has a pet, the probability might look like {'dog': 0.4, 'cat': 0.3, 'snake': 0.2, 'crocodile': 0.1} just as an illustration. Now, if you have tried out OpenAI's playground, they offer an interactive slider to play around with the variables, one of which is temperature. The less the temperature, the more greedy the model, i.e. if you set the temperature to 0, the LLM will always choose the token with the highest probability, no matter what. And so, given the temperature is 0, every time you ask the same question, the LLM-generated response will be the same.Alternatively, increasing the temperature introduces randomness. Now, the model, instead of selecting the token with the highest probability, will choose one of the options from the top n tokens with the highest probabilities; it becomes stochastic. So, for the same given question, the next token will be randomly selected and therefore the ultimate response will be different.BARD and ChatGPT use stochastic selections to make them more creative and also to appeal to the masses. It makes the LLM feel sentient."
Are popular songs considered outliers to AI,"
I was thinking about making an adversarial network to generate popular music, so one AI which generates and then two others which detect whether the song is AI generated and the expected view count of the song. The AI would thus learn to generate songs which are both realistic and popular.
However I came to a dilemma: Would popular cover songs be flagged as being AI-generated (not realistic)?
It seems like the most popular songs (Old town road, Wrecking ball, Gangnam style, crazy frog...) are all significantly different from normal music, and so would be flagged as AI generated. This would make it very difficult to generate music which satisfies both realism and popularity, since the most popular songs would have low realism scores...

In def forward method, I know what this line does but don't understand why they do this:

Why do they subtract sim.amax(*) values from sim?
Is this DDPM specific thing? I don't see this in the original Transformer.
I'm also referring to this website that explains Transformer.
Appreciate your help!
","['transformer', 'diffusion-models']","The line of code you're asking about:sim = sim - sim.amax(dim=-1, keepdim=True).detach()is a common technique used in deep learning to improve numerical stability, especially when dealing with softmax function. This operation is known as softmax stabilization or max trick.Here's why it's needed: the softmax function, which is used in the next line of the code, transforms its input into a probability distribution. However, for large input values, the exponential function used in softmax can result in very large output values, which can cause numerical instability and lead to NaN values in your computations.To prevent this, it's common to subtract the maximum value in the input to softmax. This doesn't change the result of the softmax operation (because the relative differences between input values are maintained), but it ensures that the input to the exponential function is never more than 0, which helps to keep the output values manageable and prevent overflow. Although this isn't something specific to the DDPM or the Transformer model, it's a general technique that's often used in deep learning models whenever the softmax function is applied.You can also look at this from this perspective - the main reason that line is subtracting the maximum value along the last dimension of the similarity matrix sim is for numeric stability.In the softmax calculation that follows, subtracting the maximum value prevents very large numbers from overflowing or resulting in NaN values. The softmax tries to normalize the similarities into a probability distribution, but with very high raw values, it can become unstable.Subtracting the max centers the most similar pair around zero before softmax. It shifts the whole distribution but doesn't change the relative similarities used for attention.This technique is common in transformer implementations and attention mechanisms in general. It helps control the scale of values going into softmax for better numerical stability. The original transformer paper also suggests subtracting the max for stability, so it's not specific to DDPM. It's just a useful normalization trick when dealing with unbounded similarity values that need to become probabilities via softmax."
Are LLM hallucination necessarily a bad thing?,"
I've been pondering over this for a while now: is the so-called hallucinating necessarily a problem in LLM or in AI in general? What it stands for anyway, maybe the model is trying to crunch so much information into the answer we just cannot comprehend. How could it be the model's fault since it knows only what we teach them after all?
I am trying to cover LLM hallucination here as a whole considering it as a general term many of us have read about as a known problem with LLM. For further reading and understanding different kinds of LLM hallucination I recommend to check this link and this link.
",['chatgpt'],"Although ""hallucination"" is discussed as if it were a failure mode of token-predicting LLMs (which are the core of all the recent large models), this is not really any different to normal behaviour. LLMs are not designed to output correct information, they are not trained specifically to do so, and there is no loss function or reward signal during training that encourages truth (although some fine tuning or human interaction reinforcement learning applied afterwards may adjust this to some degree).LLMs do not have inherent filters for detecting true or accurate text output. Instead they output text according to the probability that the model determines that it should appear, based on training material plus the text so far, including any ""pre-prompt"" setup plus the text supplied by user and it's own output so far.The extent that LLMs output true and accurate statements is limited to:The probability that a true statement might appear in all similar text from the training data.The ability of the model to generalise from the training data and predict accurately.For some AI systems, ability of added monitoring and control code models to detect and correct issues when they occur. These secondary models are typically far more limited than the LLMs, but may help.For some LLMs there may be fine tuning that helps the core model provide truer or more useful output.  This cannot be done at the same scale as the base training however, because it requires far more human effort per training example.In all cases, there is limited ""understanding"" of what the model outputs, in terms of real world relevance and accuracy. Mainly this is achieved because the majority of training data makes logically correct and accurate statements that the model will learn to predict approximately. It cannot refer back to other modes of knowledge though, or have any way to experience the world directly. So sometimes the text predictions produce nonsense that is well written otherwise.In my experience, this nonsense happens very easily indeed. Just ask a model an expert level question on any subject. The LLM will produce text that on a first look seems reasonable, but an actual expert in the subject will tell you it makes no sense at all in a ""not even wrong"" kind of way. This is why LLM answers are not accepted on most Stack Exchange sites."

Does it have something to do with smoothing out the token frequencies to a desired distribution? If so, what's that distribution? And how is it achieved?
Is there a separate paper about it? Or should I just dig through LLM papers?
",['natural-language-processing'],"Please look at my answer here before reading further.If you look at Tensorflow's TextVectorizer, you will find a keyword argument max_tokens. Now when you adapt your textual dataset to the TextVectorizer object, it tries to limit the vocabulary size to max_tokens. Essentially, it's a statistical method, and the lower the value of the max_tokens, the more words will be broken down into abstract tokens.Building on that, and as an illustrative example-imagine your dataset strictly contains only English words, and no punctuation marks whatsoever, and you limit your vocabulary size to 27, guess what would happen?Your final output vocabulary will be something similar to this-There is one element in the token which is a space character.In the end, the vocabulary becomes a set of tokens, using which any phrase/word/sentence/paragraph in the training data can be re-constructed.The ^ example is strictly an example, as different methods have their own standardizations, e.g. space is mostly never represented as ' ' in a token, but with a representation like a# that means after a ends put a space before the next token, etc.Now, there are many variables at play here. Ideally, we want as many tokens as possible, because the more tokens we have, theoretically, the fewer abstractions our neural network would need to learn, however, with more tokens, the time complexity rises exponentially.So, different methods have architectured different architectures to define tokens, and are available openly for commercial use. Take for example BERT's WordPiece, or GenSim (NLP library). Also keep in mind that WordPiece is a learner tokenizer, i.e. with some predefined variables, it was trained iteratively on data (Very much like TensorFlow's TextTokenizer). On the other hand, there are also statistics-based tokenizers as Stanford's word tokenizer."
What are the *non-cost-related* reasons RNN+Attention underperform Transformers?,"
There are obvious trainability and performance challenges with RNNs, such as having to process in serial and BPTT. But let's say we magically had an ""optimal"" set of weights for the RNN + Attention, as well as for the Transformer. Assume as many things about the architecture as possible are held equal between the two models. Would the inference of the RNN + Attention still be worse than that of the Transformer?
This post hints at yes; in the original ""Attention Is All You Need"" paper, the Transformer outperformed not only in cost but also in BLEU. It seems like they experimented to a degree where one could say it's not the optimization process / BPTT that failed in the RNN + Attention models, but truly when the model was saturated the performance still was worse.
Why is this?
Intuitively I feel like the set of programs that can be expressed as ""stateful"" programs is a strict superset of the set of programs that can be expressed as ""stateless"" programs, such that the only disadvantage would be that it's harder to find the optimal ""stateful"" program.

Less mutation rate is performing better in bigger neural network,"
I have a genetic AI neural network that evolves every generation and can add or remove neurons and change weights.
It evolves good in first generations with mutation rate probability of e.g. 0.005 per gene (with total 100 genes). The problem is when the neural network gets bigger (200 genes), I must decrease mutation rate. Otherwise it will be like a random search. (By gene I mean a connection between two neurons)
My question is how can I formulate a dynamic mutation rate?
Why does it become random search when genes are increased? Is having a probability based mutation rate wrong? For example should it be an static number instead of a probability or any other way?

Samples from a reverse diffusion process with cosine noise schedule blow up,"
I have implemented a diffusion probabilistic model, and I am finding some of the model behavior unexpected.
When I draw samples from an untrained reverse diffusion process with 20 denoising steps using a cosine noise schedule, I find that the elements of my final denoised samples have a magnitude of around 400 (this number increases into the 1000s if I reverse diffuse for more steps). Is it normal for the magnitude of the final denoised sample to scale with the number of diffusion steps in this way?
I have given a MWE below where I have replaced the predicted noise (provided by a neural network in a denoising diffusion probabilistic model setting) with actual noise (I don't think this matters, as you can set the predicted noise to 0 and the same effect is still observed).

Backpropagation and Gradient Descent: Questions on math behind it,"
I watched this video which goes over backpropagation calculus and read the Wikipedia page on it.  This is my understanding of the equations for the algorithm.  I have questions regarding the equations and backpropagation inline in bold font with ?.
This is a cross post from another forum because I think this forum is more appropriate.
Definitions:
$C_t$ is the cost or loss function for example $t$, $\mathbf x$ is the input vector of features, $\mathbf y$ is the target output, $L$ is the number of layers, $a$ is the activation function, $z$ is the raw activation, $w_{jk}^{(l)}$ is the weights between layer $l - 1$ and $l$, where $k$ is the index of the neuron in layer $l - 1$, $j$ is the index of the neuron in the layer $l$.  $\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. $a_j^l$ is activation of $j$-th node in layer $l$.  $C_t(\mathbf y, \mathbf a^L) = \langle (\textbf a^L - \textbf y)^2, \textbf 1 \rangle$.
The overall network for one input/output pair can be described as:
$$C_t(\mathbf y, g(\mathbf x)), g(\mathbf x) := a^L(W^L a^{L-1}(W^{L-1} \cdots a^1(W^1 \mathbf x)\cdots)), $$

Model training phase: $\mathbf x$ and $\mathbf y$ are fixed, while $w_{jk}^l$ vary.
Model evaluation phase: $w_{jk}^l$ and $\mathbf y$ are fixed, while $\mathbf x$ varies.

The following equations are from the video.
$$a_j^{(0)} = \mathbf x$$
$$C_t = \sum_{j=0}^{n_L - 1} (a_j^{(L)} - y_j)^2 = \langle (\textbf a^{(L)} - \textbf y)^2, \textbf 1 \rangle$$
$$a_j^{(L)} = \sigma(z_j^{(L)}), z_j^{(L)} = \sum_{k=0}^{n_L - 1} (w_{jk}^{(L)} a_k^{(L-1)}) + b_j^{(L)}$$
$$\frac {\partial C_t} {\partial w_{jk}^{(L)}} = \frac {\partial z_j^{(L)}} {\partial w_{jk}^{(L)}} \frac {\partial a_j^{(L)}} {\partial z_j^{(L)}} \frac {\partial C_t} {\partial a_j^{(L)}} = a_k^{(L-1)} \sigma '(z_j^{(L)}) 2(a_j^{(L)} - y_j)$$
$$\frac {\partial z_j^{(L)}} {\partial w_{jk}^{(L)}} = a_k^{(L-1)}, \frac {\partial a_j^{(L)}} {\partial z_j^{(L)}} = \sigma '(z_j^{(L)}), \frac {\partial C_t} {\partial a_j^{(L)}} = 2(a_j^{(L)} - y_j)$$
$$\frac {\partial C_t} {\partial b_{j}^{(L)}} = \frac {\partial z_j^{(L)}} {\partial b_j^{(L)}} \frac {\partial a_j^{(L)}} {\partial z_j^{(L)}} \frac {\partial C_t} {\partial a_j^{(L)}} = 1 \sigma '(z_j^{(L)}) 2(a_j^{(L)} - y_j)$$
$$\frac {\partial C_t} {\partial a_k^{(L-1)}} = \sum_{j=0}^{n_L - 1} \frac {\partial z_j^{(L)}} {\partial a_k^{(L-1)}} \frac {\partial a_j^{(L)}} {\partial z_j^{(L)}} \frac {\partial C_t} {\partial a_j^{(L)}} = \sum_{j=0}^{n_L - 1} w_{jk}^{(L)} \sigma '(z_j^{(L)}) 2(a_j^{(L)} - y_j)$$
$$\frac {\partial z_j^{L}} {\partial a_j^{(L-1)}} = w_{jk}^{(L)}$$
Average over all training examples:
$$ \frac {\partial C} {\partial w_{jk}^{(L)}} = \frac {1} {n} \sum_{t=0}^{n-1} \frac {\partial C_t} {\partial w_{jk}^{(L)}}$$
$$\frac {\partial C}{\partial b_j^{(L)}} = \frac {1} {n} \sum_{t=0}^{n-1} \frac {\partial C_t} {\partial b_{j}^{(L)}}$$
QUESTION: I tried to put this together from the video.  Is this appropriate notation for definition the gradient of the cost function given all weights and biases?
$$C \colon \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R, \nabla C \colon \mathbb R^n \to \mathbb R^n$$
$$\nabla C = \begin{bmatrix}
\frac {\partial C} {\partial w_{00}^{(1)}} \cr
\frac {\partial C} {\partial b_{0}^{(1)}} \cr
\vdots \cr
\frac {\partial C} {\partial w_{MN}^{(L)}} \cr
\frac {\partial C} {\partial b_{M}^{(L)}} \cr
\end{bmatrix} $$
The gradient descent algorithm:
$$\mathbf p_{n+1}=\mathbf p_n - \gamma \nabla C(\mathbf p_n), n \ge 0$$
$$\gamma \in \mathbb R_{+}$$
If the following is the directional derivative, then $\min_{\vec x=\vec 1} \nabla_{\vec x} C(\mathbf {\vec p})$ is a goal, which would minimize the total cost.
Where:
$$a^{(L)} = \sigma(z^{(L)}), z^{(L)} = W^{(L)} a^{(L-1)} + b^{(L)}, a^{(0)} = \mathbf x$$
$$W^{(L)} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
w_{0,0}^{(L)} & w_{0,1}^{(L)} & \dots & w_{0,n}^{(L)} \cr
w_{1,0}^{(L)} & w_{1,1}^{(L)} & \dots & w_{1,n}^{(L)} \cr
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \cr
w_{k,0}^{(L)} & w_{k,1}^{(L)} & \dots & w_{k,n}^{(L)}

BACKPROPAGATION
From Wikipedia, I inferred the following: Computing the above $\frac {\partial C_x} {\partial w_{jk}^{(L)}}$ and $\frac {\partial C_x} {\partial b_{j}^{(L)}}$ using the chain rule is inefficient.  Backpropagation computes $\nabla C$ more efficiently by computing the gradient of weighted input $\nabla_{W^l} a^{(l)} = \delta^l$ from $l = L$ (back/output) to $l = 0$ (front/input), which avoids duplicate calculations of both prior pd equations.  It also avoids unnecessary computation of $\frac {\partial z^l_j}{\partial w^l_{jk}}$.
$$\nabla_{W^l} a^{(l)} = \delta^l = (a^l)' \circ (W^{l+1})^T\cdot(a^{l+1})' \circ \cdots \circ (W^{L-1})^T \cdot (a^{L-1})' \circ (W^L)^T \cdot (a^L)' \circ \nabla_{a^L} C$$
$$\nabla_{W^l} C = \delta^l(a^{l-1})^T$$
$$\delta^{l-1} := (a^{l-1})' \circ (W^l)^T \cdot \delta^l$$
Where:
$$a^{(L)} = \sigma(z^{(L)}), z^{(L)} = (w^{(L)} a^{(L-1)}) + b^{(L)}$$
Total derivative given by:
$$df_a = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(a) \cdot dx_i$$
$$\frac{d C}{\partial x}= \frac{d C}{d a^L}\cdot \frac{d a^L}{d z^L} \cdot \frac{d z^L}{d a^{L-1}} \cdot \frac{d a^{L-1}}{d z^{L-1}}\cdot \frac{d z^{L-1}}{d a^{L-2}} \cdot \ldots \cdot \frac{d a^1}{d z^1} \cdot \frac{\partial z^1}{\partial x}$$
or equivalently expanded in functional form:
$$
\nabla_x C = (W^1)^T \cdot (a^1)' \circ \ldots \circ (W^{L-1})^T \cdot (a^{L-1})' \circ (W^L)^T \cdot (a^L)' \circ \nabla_{a^L} C
$$
Where $\nabla_{a^L} C$ and $\nabla_x C$ are the partial derivatives of $C$ with respect to $a^L$ and $x$.
For comparison if we computed $\nabla_{w^L} C$ forward the steps would be the following with repeated computations:
$$
\begin{align}
\delta^1 &= (f^1)' \circ (W^2)^T \cdot (f^2)' \circ \cdots \circ (W^{L-1})^T \cdot (f^{L-1})' \circ (W^L)^T \cdot (f^L)' \circ \nabla_{a^L} C\\
\delta^2 &= (f^2)' \circ \cdots \circ (W^{L-1})^T \cdot (f^{L-1})' \circ (W^L)^T \cdot (f^L)' \circ \nabla_{a^L} C\\
&\vdots\\
\delta^{L-1} &= (f^{L-1})' \circ (W^L)^T \cdot (f^L)' \circ \nabla_{a^L} C\\
\delta^L &= (f^L)' \circ \nabla_{a^L} C,
\end{align}
$$
Computing these values in reverse, avoids the repeated computations.

For quite some time now, I have been evaluating ChatGPT's capability to deliver accurate and helpful responses. While its performance is undeniably impressive, the issue of hallucinations poses a significant drawback to this otherwise capable model.
As I increased the complexity of my inputs during several sessions, my initial enthusiasm and excitement about the advancements in AI quickly waned due to the responses becoming riddled with hallucinations. This has seriously raised my concerns about the reliability and usefulness of chatGPT.
I have two questions:

Is there a declining interest among people in LLMs and artificial intelligence due to the problem of hallucinations?
How are LLM companies addressing and combatting this concerning aspect of AI models in general?

","['generative-model', 'chatgpt', 'large-language-models']",The answer to question 1 is I think a clear no. You can get useful output from LLMs without the hallucinations being a problem.If you are not an expect on a subject the LLMs output can be educationalAlso some people are using the output as the basis for their own work without using it verbatim.There are examples of people using it to provide the outline of an email or even a story which the user then completes.In the world of software it can be used as a better intellisense even though when asked to produce code it can produce code that is at best non-optimal and at times dangerously wrong.Unfortunately of course there will be people who don't use models with sufficient dilligence and will try to use them to exploit opportunities such as mass marketing or phishing and some people will be sold even in spite of of glaring problems.This and the flaws create a potential image problem for this kind of AI but the obvious benefits and conveniences outweigh the flaws.Question 2 is much more interestingMy feeling is that the answer is to use LLMs as a component of a more intelligent system rather than as the main driving engine of it.This is a view shared by many others for example (mostly random selection):Whether companies choose to focus on the LLM side or pivot to work on combined system will depend on the company. I expect wealthly companies like openai to be more likely to use that wealth to do so. LLMs coming out of big companies like Google/Alphabet already have that machinery behind them.That is not to say that hallucinations in LLMs are not a problem in and of themselves that is not worth addressing because it certainly is and there is of lot research going into that area which other people can probably describe much better than I.

How to use diffusion models to draw on top of image?,"
I am thinking about a pipeline that involves multiple diffusion networks. The first one generates an image from a prompt, a use case that is well-documented in literature. The following networks however should draw on top of the output image from step 1, without altering that image (except for the overdrawings of course), so they would be img2img diffusion networks, conditioned on the input image and with the hard restriction not to alter that input image.
A simple example use case would be a first diffusion model that draws an anime character from a prompt, and a second one that draws the outline of the anime character a lot thicker, and a third one that draws evil-looking eyes on top of the real eyes.
Is there any research as to how to achieve this?

On page 468 of 'Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning', what does 'the same variables given by the product of two independent univariate Gaussian distributions' mean?
The PDF says,

The green contours corresponding to 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations
for a correlated Gaussian distribution p(z) over two variables z1 and
z2, and the red contours represent the corresponding levels for an
approximating distribution q(z) over the same variables given by the
product of two independent univariate Gaussian distributions whose
parameters are obtained by minimization of (a) the KullbackLeibler
divergence KL(q||p), and (b) the reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence
KL(p||q).

but I don't understand the explanation clearly.
Which is the same variables?
Which is the two distributions?
What is the product? Does it mean the probability density function?
Thanks.

How does the linear layer step work and what should I do at the end of the LSTM?,"
So basically I've read some text about LSTM, and luckily they mentioned the linear layer step at the end of the LSTM Process. However, they didn't explain how it works or what I would need to convert the hidden state into understandable and useable information. To be clear I do not want a Pytorch implementation of this. I am making my LSTM in C on arduino. If you don't know how to code in C or it is too time-consuming to make an example, a simple explanation without too much math detail, but enough that I get the basic idea of what to do is just as good. If you don't know how to explain it in a rookie friendly way, the article I found, which I mentioned above, does a pretty good job. The name is ""LSTM Networks | A Detailed Explanation"" by Rian Dolphin and can be found on towardsdatascience.com. I normally would give the link, but the last time I did that, people got mad.
Thank you so much if you respond
Edit: Wait, is it just another ANN on top of it.

How is the padding mask incorporated in the attention formula?,"
I have been looking for the answer in other questions but no one tackled that. I want to ask you how is the padding mask considered in the formula of attention?
The attention formula taking into account a causal mask is:
$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\frac{QK^{T} + CausalMask}{\sqrt{d_{k}}})V$
But how do we add the padding mask? The aim of a padding mask is to mask the padding positions as they're used just to make the batching feasible. But I don't know how this mask is added in the Attention formula.
Does it make sense if we do element-wise multiplication of the Attention matrix with a tensor of ones of shape (batch size, sequence length, $d_{model}$) and whatever sentence $s$ in that batch and wherever position $p$ is a padding token then the tensor[s, p, :] is zeros?
Thank you in advance for your help!
","['natural-language-processing', 'transformer', 'attention', 'sequence-modeling', 'padding']","Entries of an attention mask are typically either $0$ or $-\infty$.So, adding such a mask gives either the original entry of $QK^T$ or $-\infty$.The issue with entrywise multiplication with a binary matrix, is that $0$ values still contribute to softmax.$$softmax(z)_i = \frac{e^{z_i}}{\sum_k e^{z_k}}$$$e^0$ is $1$, so element-wise product before softmax is not really a mask. After softmax doesn't work either, since the output is no longer a probability distribution. To ensure the masked elements do not contribute at all, you need them to be $-\infty$, which mask addition does.If you know that certain indices of the input of are padded, that is, they are all zero vectors, then the padding tokens are already ignored by matmul (since they are zero). The issue is the rows of $QK^T$ corresponding to the pad tokens are zero and not $-\infty$.To ignore pad tokens, you would create a mask with $-\infty$ along columns corresponding to the location of padding, and add this to $QK^T$ before softmax. So it's just the same attention formula, different value of $M$."
Deep Q problem. Some q-Values are always greater,"
Description
My problem is to make actor play on stock market. I am trying to teach him playing on some portion of data. I interpolated data to uniformed interals and normalized or standarized all features the way I though is correct. Most of them are <0,1>
I have few neural networks, using different architectures.
But they face same problems. They seems not to learn.
Model
In input I pass

data input (2d time series data)

actor state (1 or 0)
currently it is just 0 or 1, depending if actor has any asset


I predict 3 actions q-values.



Buy




Pass




Sell



Example model:

Parameters
I used $1e-5$ learning rate and batch of 2000.
Discount: I used $0.98$ before, but picture below is $discount=0.1$
Using bellman equation for deep LR
$Q(a,s) $ ← $reward + \gamma * max(Q(s'))$
    new_vector = rewards + discount * max_future_argq * (1 - dones.astype(int))
    for i, (ac, v) in enumerate(zip(actions, new_vector)):
        curr_qvals[i, ac] = v

Training with new qvals
envs_states_arr - env array of shape (actors, timewindow, features)
states - actor states of shape (actors, 1)
history_ob = mod.fit([envs_states_arr, states], new_qvals, shuffle=True,
                             batch_size=mini_batchsize,
                             verbose=False)

Reward function
discrete_stock is hidden integer for given actor, it means amount of items actor has
price - normalized price in given state.
BASE_PENALTY $ = -1$
INVALID_MOVE $ = -10$
False and True are indicating valid moves just for me.
if action == 0:
    ""BUY""
    if discrete_stock == 0:
        return -price, True
    else:
        return INVALID_MOVE, False

elif action == 1:
    ""PASS""
    return 3 * BASE_PENALTY, True

elif action == 2:
    ""SELL""
    if discrete_stock <= 0:
        return INVALID_MOVE, False

    return price * 2, True

More about problem
I think it is already small learning rate. Should I go even lower learning rate and bigger batch size?
I am confused about this problem. You can see there are some -10 rewards in plot, so some outputs had invalid move, yet I don't see model to set any actions in that direction.

Is model learning?
Loss is going very low. So is my solution designed wrong?

Which models can be applied recursively?,"
I come from a math background, so I am not up-to-date with machine learning literature.
For the purpose of learning dynamics, I would like to train a model to minimize the following loss:
$$\mathcal{L} = |\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{M}(x)) - y|,$$
more generally, there can be $k \geq 2$ recursive applications of the model $\mathcal{M}$.
From my experimentation, regular fully-connected neural networks perform poorly—a single application of $\mathcal{M}$ performs better and intermediate results do not correspond to intermediate data.
Are there other architectures that are better suited for this problem? Maybe graph-based models or the U-net from DDPMs?
Edit: Just a note on RNNs (I could be completely wrong): Although RNNs are used for recursive applications, I don't think they are what I am looking for. RNNs accept a sequence of inputs, whereas my input is a single tensor. Also, going from one hidden state to the next corresponds to a matrix multiplication which seems not very expressive(?).

Is neural fictitious self play violating off-policy theorem,"
I was reading the NFSP player from D. Silver, and I'm somewhat confused by the algorithm:

In particular, given that we sample an action according to best response ($\sigma = \epsilon-\text{greedy}(Q)$), we also insert this transition in $\mathcal{M}_{RL}$, over which then we will estimate the gradient for the policy $\pi$... however, since this action has not been sampled from the policy $\pi$, it biases the gradient, which usually should be corrected by the importance sampling ratio
what am I missing?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'game-theory', 'self-play']","over which then we will estimate the gradient for the policy π
...It seems like you might be misunderstanding the type of algorithm. This (NFSP) doesn't use return of $\Pi$ as a loss. If Heinrich & Silver were using a policy gradient method, they would, you would encounter the issue of the gradient being off-policy.This is actually strictly a Q Learning algorithm. The policy of the MDP is epsilon-greedy based on our Q estimator. The policy function $\Pi$ is an estimator for $\epsilon\text{-greedy}(Q)$, and is trained using SL according to negative-log-likelihood.What you would need to be careful of when implementing this NFSP is when you clear the replay memories. If you update your Q-network parameters $\theta^{Q} \leftarrow \theta^{Q'}$ (an easy mistake) and continue sampling, your trajectory distribution will be different. However, the algorithm described in the paper is entirely on-policy."

Why does LLM inference cost scale in both input tokens and output tokens?,"
EDIT
This question was flawed. See my answer with help from commenters.

Original question
This question has been asked in other forums [1] [2] but I'm not sure I understand the claims, which are (EDIT: the following are based on my faulty assumption that pad tokens are added up to the maximum context window):

Each forward pass takes less resources when more of the context window is padding.
Forward passes are run on the input tokens.
Forward passes with fewer non-pad input tokens are smaller tensor operations.

Hypothesis 1 seems the most plausible to me from a performance engineering standpoint (sparse math, etc). Does it fall out naturally from just writing basic JAX code or would it require manual optimization (if so, what tricks can be used?)? There does seem to be some research on this.
Hypothesis 2 and 3 seem wrong based on my surface-level understanding of the Transformer architecture.
I've tried a few open-source LLMs locally and neither on those nor ChatGPT have I noticed any difference in latency based on how much text was in the context window. But I haven't done actual rigorous benchmarking yet.
The reason this is relevant is due to document lookup-based applications. Looking at the OpenAI cookbook for Q&A using embeddings, I can see that:

most of the token usage seems to come from the long Wikipedia article pasted into the context
the price per query is quite prohibitive to frequent usage:


For gpt-3.5-turbo using ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~0.002 per query, or ~500 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)
For gpt-4, again assuming ~1,000 tokens per query, it costs ~0.03 per query, or ~30 queries per dollar (as of Apr 2023)

My prior intuition would have been that optimal usage of LLMs would be to keep the context filled with inexpensive text (e.g. from NN search and/or cheaper LMs) and to have the LLM generate terse responses. But the input token cost model changes the strategy, as it means that users need to be sparing about the size and quantity of documents that they paste into the context window.
","['transformer', 'open-ai', 'embeddings', 'large-language-models', 'inference']","Transformers can be run with a variable dimension N_INPUT as pointed out by @pcpthm's comment. That means that the answer to ""Why do transformers have a fixed input length?"" are wrong, and the answers to ""How do transformers handle arbitrary-length input?"" are more correct.If the input of dimension N_INPUT * N_VOCAB and N_INPUT is variable then that simply means Q, K, V, Z have one variable dimension (N_INPUT * D_ATTN_HEAD) and input/output of MLP are just N_INPUT * WIDTH.For some reason I thought the hidden layers would be fixed size and/or require a fixed size input, but this is not the case since it turns out that N_INPUT is always the first dimension, except in the result of Q * K^T which has dimension N_INPUT * N_INPUT, but is only multiplied on the right by V which has first dimension N_INPUT.In the NNs that I'd learned about previously, N_INPUT is the second dimension so even if one were to put in a variable input, all of the hidden layers would still be fixed-size.Particularly what I did not realize is that the ""context window"" is not actually a part of the model (except in the positional encoding). It seems to be purely a training time / inference time restriction."
Does anyone recognize this formula to quantify the likelihood that a transformer will generate the same response twice?,"
The idea is simple enough. Just multiply the likelihood of filling in the blank with the same result as the original response.
$$\prod_{s:substring}^{t:string}P(t|masked(t,s))$$
Motivation:
Rather than estimating P(response|prompt) directly, it may also be useful to estimate confidence values for masked substrings. This helps identify regions of high confidence ""The color of the sky is [?]."" vs regions of low confidence ""The color of the [?] is blue.""

good period prediction but bad magnitude using keras LSTM neural network,"
I want to predict the voltage of a battery along time using neural networks. This voltage is read using an ADC and generates a charge/discharge profile that ideally looks like this:

Which goes very similar along time (up to hundreds of cycles) but with a different period each cycle (even each charge/discharge part), depending on if the battery is being charged or discharged (one cycle is one charge + one discharge). Tch stands for charge period and Tdc for discharge period. I want to predict this voltage in future cycles. Specifically, my main objective is to predict with accuracy the period of each cycle, to know if this period increases or decreases.
I already have a data set with 1 million samples (one sample is the voltage value each 2 seconds), which I used to train and predict an LSTM using keras. The results are pretty good: for the train part of the set,  RMSE = 0.01; and for the test part, it is 0.01 The following figure shows the actuals vs predictions for some of the cycles, where both period and magnitude matches almost perfectly:

My problem comes when I try to predict on a new smaller dataframe (around 4000 samples): the period is predicted perfectly but the magnitude it is not (blue is actuals and green is prediction). For example, the maximum voltage values are larger in the prediction than in the actuals (more than 5V vs no more than 1.7V). I have plotted it in different axes to see better the differences:

Is there anyway to improve the magnitude prediction but maintaining the nice quality of the period prediction?

Does 1 Training Example (Approximately) Fix 1 Parameter of a MLP network?,"
I'm thinking from the math perspective of: ""you need as many equations as unknowns"". And thinking the loss on each training example (with 1 output variable) as one such equation.
Also I realize that in practice (if say you use ReLU), some neurons may be ""dead"" right off the bat & that SGD isn't perfect, so it's unlikely to be ""exactly true"". But I'm wonder if under ideal circumstances it is true or if it is approximately true in general.

"In theory, LSTM should be adequate to solve my problem, but it doesn't","
I am currently doing my Master's Thesis in the area of wireless sensing using radio waves. I have 4 receiver distributed in the corners of my room and each of them records so called Channel Impulse Responses in the time domain. This is basically a correlation of how the radio wave is influenced by the room and they look like this:
https://www.researchgate.net/figure/LOS-channel-impulse-response-and-NLOS-channel-impulse-response_fig1_308986067
Each CIR is 300 samples long in my case and given $i, j$, $j$ is dependent on $i$ if $j\geq i$.
Thus, the data I feed into my LSTM has the size Nx300x4, where N is the batch size.
Why I thought LSTM should work here is that the correlation from each sample to the previous samples for each receiver directly relates to the changes happening in the room (not within one single 300x4 sample but over multiple samples). You can think of the data as 4 sentences with 300 words each.
The only thing that is a bit confusing here is that the LSTM implementation (at least in PyTorch) returns a vector with size 300xhidden for a single input.
I am reducing the 300xhidden vector to the number of classes I have using a flatten + linear layer but I am not sure if this is correct?
Nonetheless, the LSTM is much worse than my CNN implementation - but why? If I may bring back the analogy to the 4 sentences with 300 words - wasn't LSTM the NN of choice for text analysis before transformer?

What's the architecture that allows the generation of new images based on input image in tools like Midjourney?,"
I understand that the high-level architecture of tools like Midjourney use diffusion models to generate images from text. What I don't understand is which type of network architecture allow the second step of their workflow - generating new, similar images conditioned on a selected input image. This post seems to mention ControlNet as a way to condition image output based on image input, but it seems like ControlNet would require additional training to yield useful results, so I don't see how that would work in a Midjourney-like workflow.
Any links to relevant publications or blog articles would help as well.
","['generative-model', 'diffusion-models', 'midjourney']","Midjourney (and DALL-E 2 I think) uses a concept vector (or ""embedding"") to condition its image outputs, which can be produced in at least two ways:The concept space is the same for these two processes, although the input stages of the analysis are different architectures (an RNN for text, a CNN for images). So the results of multiple text prompts and image prompts can be combined using a weighted mean, and this is how multi-prompts plus image weighting work. Everything goes into the same embedding vector that is used to condition the diffusion reversal functions.The CLIP model by OpenAI is an example architecture which does this. It is trained with image and caption pairs to produce a pair of models which can convert either text or image inputs into a shared embedding or ""concept space"". Midjourney is likely using their own version of CLIP, perhaps trained on their own dataset, or something very similar - their models are proprietry though, so this is an educated guess.Note this model is separate to the diffusion model, and helps produce inputs to it. When you start a generation with multiple image and text prompts:ControlNet is an entirely different way to influence the diffusion denoising function. Midjourney, as of version 5.2, does not have any equivalent.The Midjourney base process also does not use img2img - which is another way to use an input image. This uses a partially-noised version of the image as a starting point, instead of pure noise. The Midjourney variations, zoom and pan features do use this kind of influence, so it appears the raw model does support the feature, but Midjourney service does not allow customers to control it in full, for instance by uploading their own images, because of potential for abuse."

Batch Normalization Layer is not learning the data semantics of a dataset comprised of datasets from different sources,"
I have built a dataset for image segmentation that is comprised of datasets from several different sources.
Almost all of my models have problems with learning the correct parameters of the batchnormalization layer, the networks are very deep and it helps a lot keeping them, but if I put them into evaluation mode (i.e. not compute the batch normalization of the input but the learned one) there is a huge drop of performance.
I presume the statistics of the different datasets source images are very different.
The labels might also contain different amount of noise.
I have tried normalizing the images to standard channel mean and standard deviation, centered around 0 and 0.5.
What else could I try?

What to do with not used variables when optimising a fitness function?,"
I'm optimising a fitness function using a GA. DNN is used to compute the fitness function using 4 input variables. The original data has 8 variables but to optimise DNN accuracy I have dropped 4 variables. Now the best solution exists of only the 4 parameters used. The complete solution should contain 8. The difference in DNN accuracy is significant, the MSE dropped from around 150 to around 20. I can't use all variables. Should I simply ignore the others? Or use some other method? Please let me know if you have any ideas/suggestions.

Best way to generate fitness landscape when using higher dimensional data,"
I'm using a GA to find the best set of parameters to maximize a fitness function. I want to draw a fitness landscape to visualize the effectiveness of the algorithm. The fitness function, calculated using a DNN, has 8 input variables. The landscape I want to plot is 3 dimensional (x,y,fitness). What data should I assign to the x and y axes? Or should I avoid such a plot entirely? Which other types of plots would be better?
","['optimization', 'genetic-algorithms', 'fitness-functions', 'data-visualization']","I understood your question as being ""I have a fitness function based on 8 parameters"" how can I display that graphically.Visualising a multi-dimensional landscape is a hard problem.
If you convert it to some kind of 3d plot you are inevitably losing information.
It would help to consider what you are actually trying to achieve by doing so.
Do you have a practical use for the plot or is it just a bright shiny.If you want to show something specific such as how one algorithm is better than another, you may be better off trying to visualise something else entirely.
Commonly you can look at the average fitness over time instead.A better algorithm is typically one that increases fitness more quickly and/or with fewer resources.So you could plot fitness by time by population with different coloured lines for each algorithm variation say.That said if you really want to visualise the fitness landscape:There a some useful information on or linked to the wikipedia page on Fitness_landscapesYou could also try:You could try [dimensionality reduction](Dimensionality reduction) to reduce the number of parameters down to something you can plot.Look at which dimensions have the most intersting changes over timeCreate multiple plots for different interesting pairs fo dimensionsWhy stick with 3D?

How is this Pytorch expression equivalent to the KL divergence?,"
I found the following PyTorch code (from this link)
-0.5 * torch.sum(1 + sigma - mu.pow(2) - sigma.exp())

where mu is the mean parameter that comes out of the model and sigma is the sigma parameter out of the encoder. This expression is apparently equivalent to the KL divergence. But I don't see how this calculates the KL divergence for the latent.
","['pytorch', 'proofs', 'implementation', 'variational-autoencoder', 'kl-divergence']","The code is correct. Since OP asked for a proof, one follows.The usage in the code is straightforward if you observe that the authors are using the symbols unconventionally: sigma is the natural logarithm of the variance, where usually a normal distribution is characterized in terms of a mean $\mu$ and variance. Some of the functions in OP's link even have arguments named log_var.$^*$If you're not sure how to derive the standard expression for KL Divergence in this case, you can start from the definition of KL divergence and crank through the arithmetic. In this case, $p$ is the normal distribution given by the encoder and $q$ is the standard normal distribution.
$$\begin{align}
D_\text{KL}(P \| Q) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log\left(\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}\right) dx \\
&= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log(p(x)) dx - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log(q(x)) dx
\end{align}$$
The first integral is recognizable as almost definition of entropy of a Gaussian (up to a change of sign).
$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log(p(x)) dx = -\frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \log(2\pi\sigma_1^2) \right)
$$
The second one is more involved.
$$
\begin{align}
-\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} p(x) \log(q(x)) dx 
&= \frac{1}{2}\log(2\pi\sigma_2^2) - \int p(x) \left(-\frac{\left(x - \mu_2\right)^2}{2 \sigma_2^2}\right)dx \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\log(2\pi\sigma_2^2) + \frac{\mathbb{E}_{x\sim p}[x^2] - 2 \mathbb{E}_{x\sim p}[x]\mu_2 +\mu_2^2} {2\sigma_2^2} \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\log(2\pi\sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + \mu_1^2-2\mu_1\mu_2+\mu_2^2}{2\sigma_2^2} \\
&= \frac{1}{2}\log(2\pi\sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2\sigma_2^2}
\end{align}
$$
The key is recognizing this gives us a sum of several integrals, and each can apply the law of the unconscious statistician. Then we use the fact that $\text{Var}(x)=\mathbb{E}[x^2]-\mathbb{E}[x]^2$. The rest is just rearranging.Putting it all together:
$$
\begin{align}
D_\text{KL}(P \| Q) &= -\frac{1}{2}\left(1 + \log(2\pi\sigma_1^2) \right) + \frac{1}{2}\log(2\pi\sigma_2^2) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2\sigma_2^2} \\
&= \log (\sigma_2) - \log(\sigma_1) + \frac{\sigma_1^2 + (\mu_1 - \mu_2)^2}{2\sigma_2^2} - \frac{1}{2}
\end{align}
$$In this special case, we know that $q$ is a standard normal, so
$$
\begin{align}
D_\text{KL}(P \| Q) &= -\log \sigma_1 + \frac{1}{2}\left(\sigma_1^2 + 
\mu_1^2 - 1 \right) \\
&= - \frac{1}{2}\left(1 + 2\log \sigma_1- \mu_1^2 -\sigma_1^2   \right)
\end{align}
$$
In the case that we have a $k$-variate normal with diagonal covariance for $p$, and a multivariate normal with covariance $I$, this is the sum of $k$ univariate normal distributions because in this case the distributions are independent.The code is a correct implementation of this expression because $\log(\sigma_1^2) = 2 \log(\sigma_1)$ and in the code, sigma is the logarithm of the variance.$^*$The reason that it's convenient to work on the scale of the log-variance is that the log-variance can be any real number, but the variance is constrained to be non-negative by definition. It's easier to perform optimization on the unconstrained scale than it is to work on the constrained scale in $\eta^2$. Also, we want to avoid ""round-tripping,"" where we compute $\exp(y)$ in one step and then $\log(\exp(y))$ in a later step, because this incurs a loss of precision. In any case, autograd takes care of all of the messy details with adjustments to gradients resulting from moving from one scale to another."

How to handle penalty and reward occurring simultaneously,"
Assume the following scenario:

We have an agent that acts on an environment where the agent should never take an action that results in him leaving the environment. For example, imagine an agent playing tennis and he should never run over the lines that determine the field.
However, it may occur that the agent has to cross the lines in order to hit the ball (let's stick to the tennis game). In that case he would get a reward for hitting the ball and a penalty for leaving the arena.

I wonder what approach would be better:
Only give the agent a reward while he is in the arena, so in our example he would not get any reward while outside of the arena.
Or sum up the penalty and reward, so the agent always gets the reward, regardless if he hurt the constraints or not.
I thought that giving him the reward, even when outside of the arena, could encourage him to keep hurting the constraints. On the other hand, I fear that not giving the reward, he would miss out on learning how to hit the ball.
Which approach would be superior?

Handling Feature Selection Discrepancy in Image Classification Model,"
I have developed an image classification model that categorizes images into two classes (we'll say good and bad for the sake of example) based on a set of tags. To improve the model's performance, I performed feature selection, which resulted in a subset of informative features. However, I encountered a challenge when dealing with a new batch of images.
The issue is that some features used in the initial feature selection process are present only in the first dataset, while other features are exclusive to the new batch. To address this discrepancy, I decided to select the features that are common to both sets (the intersection of the two feature sets) and retrain the model using these shared features.
While this approach seems logical to me, I would appreciate additional perspectives and insights on how to handle this situation more effectively. Is selecting the intersection of features a valid approach, or are there alternative methods or considerations that I should be aware of? I am open to suggestions and recommendations to improve the feature selection process and ensure robust classification performance for the new batch of images.
Thank you in advance for your insights and advice!

What would be an appropriate way of making an AI for Cell Machine?,"
The game Cell Machine is absolutely by itself not suitable for AI usage, but a certain niche within a mod of the game (Mystic Mod) known as ""vaults"" does seem like a suitable use case for AI. It involves making and solving vaults out of cells. It's entirely deterministic. These cells move in predetermined fashions each tick. The creator of a vault's goal is to to protect an enemy cell, and the solver wants to destroy this enemy cell. As the dataset for vaults and their solves is extremely small, this would have to be dealt with using self play. Could a framework like AlphaZero work, or would I have to build something from scratch? Note: Large Language Models surprisingly show some success at creating these vaults, but that would not be an improvable way.

What do I need to learn to tackle the following problem: make a program that optimizes decisions in the game PlateUp!,"
So, recently my friends and I have been hooked on a videogame called PlateUp!. The game is kind of a management game where the objective is to succesfully run a restaurant. The game can be roughly described as an endless loop of:

A passive phase, in which you organize your kitchen, tools and other stuff. In this phase you also get to buy, upgrade or duplicate items, and sometimes you're forced to choose a ""card"" that changes some behaviour in the game.

An active phase, in which customers show up and you must tend to them in real time and make sure they don't get tired of waiting and leave (if a single customer exceeds their impatience meter, it's game over)


My friends and I have been having fun coming up with strategies and optimizations for the game, and thought it'd be fun to try to come up with a program that plays the game and comes up with its own strategies to see what it does (mostly in the planning phase, since the active phase is more concerned with flawless execution of tasks)
So we'd like to make an AI that plays the game that makes no mistakes in the active phase (this sounds like the easy part) but also I'd like to make one that at each turn decides which debuffs to pick, which items to buy, how to organize the kitchen, etc. Its objective would then be to have the longest possible run in the game.
I've never done anything remotely close to this (most I've done related to AI is program a simple MLP and a GHA for some simple learning tasks) but I don't know how these kind of optimization problems can or should be tackled

Unit 1 has higher values when the duration of roasting is too little. Unit 2 has higher values for bad combinations of temperature and time. The blue-hatched regions show the layer outputted higher activations for the respective unit.
I used a threshold of 0.5
So I can conclude higher activations from layer 1 give an output class of 0. But as I used the sigmoid activation function I thought that large values give an output class of 1. And very small values give a 0, due to the S-shape.

Correction of value update in off policy TD(0),"
In this question (inherited from slides coming from D. Silver) they are arguing that the value update in off policy TD(0) should be:
$$
V(S_t) = V(S_t) + \alpha \left( \frac{ \pi(A_t|S_t)}{\mu (A_t|S_t)} (R_{t+1} + \gamma V(S_{t+1})) - V(S_t) \right) 
$$
And the answer is saying that if $\pi(a|s) = 0$  then this formula will counterbalance the ""overestimation""
However, I really don't see this overestimation in the derivation.
Moreover, in the RL book ok Sutton and Barto, in the off-policy td(0) (section 11.1 ""Semi-gradient Methods""), they clearly states:

Here the whole error is weighted by the importance sampling ratio, which makes sense in the case $\pi(a|s)=0$, because ""if i'll never do that action, my value should not consider that branch of the tree""
Any idea?

REINFORCE with Baseline not Learning,"
I have implemented REINFORCE using PyTorch and am testing it on the CartPole environment. My implementation allows for an optional baseline to be applied. At present, the baseline used is simply the mean of the returns earned during an episode.
The agent will learn a good policy when I DO NOT use a baseline, but when I apply the baseline, the agent fails to learn anything. I cannot figure out why. I have experimented with the learning rate quite a bit, but that hasn't gotten me anywhere.
I notice that the loss is always very close to zero when using the baseline, but it seems like that should be expected. When the network weights are still random, most of the actions will have a probability that is near 0.5, and thus a log probability that is close to log(0.5) ~=~ -0.7. The returns for this environment are symmetric about the mean, so the weighted sum of the centered returns should be close to zero if the weights (log probs) are nearly equal. But the loss shouldn't be exactly zero unless the probabilities are all identical, which is not the case.
Here is a link to a Colab notebook with my code: REINFORCE Implementation

Why can't Lucene search be used to power LLM applications?,"
w.r.t. LLM applications using the RAG (retriever-augmented-generation) architecture, people have started taken it for granted that it will be powered by a vector database. e.g., see this:

The most important piece of the preprocessing pipeline, from a systems standpoint, is the vector database.

Why can't lucene index (full-text search) be used for the retriever? Is there any objective study that has been done comparing quality of results using full-text search vs. using a vector database?
As I was writing this, even lucene seems to have jumped on the vector bandwagon. see this

"If the agent is at the same state but at different times and receives a different reward, wouldn't this be violating somehow the MDP assumption?","
I've been trying to train an agent, I've received and read suggestions to improve its speed to reach the goal. The suggestion is to use a time penalty, for example, adding $-0.1$ to the reward each time step.
However, at a first glance, it seems weird to use it because in the core of all RL algorithms we assume that it is a Markov decision process, so it should be able to choose the best action based on the current observation of the environment alone.
If the agent is at the same state but at different times and receives a different reward, wouldn't this be violating somehow the MDP assumption? Or at least preventing it from learning? Because it has no time parameter to learn anything related to time (i.e this state yielded worst expected return because it is in a later time step)

Why does averaging attention-weighted positions reduce the effective resolution in transformers?,"
I was reading this blog post from Harvard and it says in its background paragraph about transformers that the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions doesn't grow in the distance between positions with the transformers architecture but this comes at the ""cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions"".
I don't understand why does the averaging of attention-weighted position reduces the effective resolution. I have developed below the calculations needed to get the attention output, for the sake of simplicity I'm only considering one head:
The definition is:
$A = Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(\frac{QK^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}})V$
I think we can see this in two ways, either we see that $softmax(\frac{QK^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}})$ is an $(m, m)$ matrix if $m$ is the number of input tokens, let us denote this matrix $M$, and since $V$ is a the input matrix $X$ multiplied by a weight matrix $W^{V}$, that gives us $A = M*X*W^{V}$ and we can clearly see that every element of $A$ is bound to all element in $X$ and that makes the resolution as high as possible.
We can also see it if we completely develop all the calculations inside the matrix $A$. I will do just one element here for the sake of simplicity: $A_{1,1} = \sum_{j=1}^{m}\frac{e^{Q_{1}K_{j}^{T}}V_{j, 1}}{\beta_{1}}$
Where $m$ is the number of input tokens, $Q_{i}, K_{j}$ are the i-th and j-th rows of $Q$ and $K$ respectively and $v_{j, 1}$ is the first element of the j-th row in $V$. And $\beta_{1} = \sum_{j=1}^{m}e^{Q_{1}K_{j}^{T}}$ (the softmax denominator).
Let's say $X$, the input matrix is of shape $(m, d_{e})$, then $Q = X*W^{Q}$ is of shape $(m, d_{k})$ and $K = X*W^{K}$ is of shape $(m, d_{k})$ too if we consider that $W^{Q}$ and $W^{K}$ are both of shape $(d_{e}, d_{k})$.
Now, If we examine the product $Q_{1}K_{j}^{T}$, it is $\sum_{l=1}^{d_{k}}Q_{1,l}K_{j,l}^{T}=\sum_{l=1}^{d_{k}}(\sum_{p=1}^{d_{e}}X_{1,p}W_{p,l}^{Q})(\sum_{p=1}^{d_{e}}X_{j,p}W_{p,l}^{k})$, we can see that with the indices $p$ going from $1$ to $d_{e}$ and the $j$ index going from $1$ to $m$, we cover all the elements of $X$ in the first position of $A$. Granted that this is inside an exponential and that we divide by the softmax denominator. But if we develop the $V_{j, 1}$, it is $\sum_{p=1}^{d_{v}}X_{j,p}W_{p,1}^{V}$, and again we cover all the elements of $X$.
My guess is that there is a subtlety in the claim of the article that stems from the ""effective resolution"", but I wonder what a full resolution would be in that case, since even in the fully connected networks we have a linear transformation of inputs so we can argue that we're not directly using all the inputs.
I hope someone can clarify this for me and help me gain more understanding of the transformers architecture.
Thank you!

Can a Fully Connected Neural Network represent all Neural Networks of smaller size?,"
A fully connected Neural Network architecture can be characterized by a vector $\mathbf a = (a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_L)\in\mathbb N^{L+1}$ and an activation function $\sigma :\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$. In this setting, $a_0$ is the input dimension and $a_L$ the output dimension of the network. $L$ represent its depth (the number of hidden layers) and $W:=\max_{1\le i\le L} a_i$ represents its width (the hidden layer with the highest number of neurons).
With that formalism, given a set of parameters $\boldsymbol\theta := \Big((A_l,b_l)\Big)_{l=1}^L \in \Big(\mathbb R^{a_1\times a_0}\times\mathbb R^{a_1}\Big)\times\cdots\times\Big(\mathbb R^{a_L\times a_{L-1}}\times\mathbb R^{a_L}\Big)$, the function realized by a neural network with architecture vector $\mathbf a$, activation function $\sigma$ and parameters $\boldsymbol \theta$ is given by
$$\mathcal F_{\boldsymbol\theta} : x\in\mathbb R^{a_0}\mapsto \mathcal A_{(A_L,b_L)}\circ\sigma\circ\cdots\circ\sigma\circ \mathcal{A}_{(A_1,b_1)}(x) $$
Where $\mathcal{A}_{(A_l,b_l)}(x):= A_l x + b_l$ and $\sigma$ is applied componentwise. This mathematical formulation of Fully Connected Neural Networks is taken from, e.g., this paper by Berner et al. (2020) (page 3).
My question is now the following : consider a neural network with architecture vector $\mathbf a$, depth $L$, width $W$ activation function $\sigma$ and fixed parametrization $\boldsymbol\theta$. For any other architecture vector $\mathbf a'$ with depth $L'\ge L$, number of neurons in each layer satisfying $a_l'\ge W\ \forall 1\le l\le L-1$ and activation function $\sigma$, is it possible to find a parametrization $\boldsymbol \theta'$ such that
$$ \mathcal F_{\boldsymbol\theta} (x)= \mathcal F_{\boldsymbol\theta'}(x)\ \ \forall x\in\mathbb R^{a_0 }\ ?$$
(of course, we need to assume $a_0' = a_0$ and $a_{L'}' = a_L$). In words, I am asking : can Neural Networks with more computation units in each layer AND more hidden layers represent ALL neural networks with fewer computation units and hidden layers ?
Intuitively, I am pretty sure that the answer is yes : for instance, if we don't increase the depth but only the number of neurons in each hidden layer, we can simply reproduce the smaller network with a properly chosen subset of the units, and set everything else to zero. The problem if we add more layers and do as I just said is that we now need to have the identity function from the $L$-th to $L'$-th layer, which is not feasible exactly for any reasonable activation function (I am mostly interested in ReLU, in which case a good approximation on a compact set is possible, but not an exact equality). Because deeper networks are more expressive, I would bet that the result still holds in that case.
I would appreciate an answer containing a proof and/or a reference (I am fine with adding more assumptions if needed). Thank you in advance.

Does data preprocessing is necessary and important in deep learning?,"
I really wonder about data preprocessing is really necessary and important in deep learning.
It's really hard to say clearly about difference between Machine learning and deep learning. In definetion, The difference is whether or not humans intervene in the process of finding features. Machine learning need humans intervene to do feature extraction, so must need data preprocessing. So we do PCA, denoising, data balancing, and so on.
Machine learning is important to pre-processing. But, In deep learning, Is really important to do preprocessing at data? I'm not asking about such as embedding in NLP. text embedding is necessary for transform text to computer recognizable.
I'm really confused while studying about deep-learning. Someone says that it's important to do pre-processing, and someone says that isn't important to do pre-processing.
For example, I'll show some situation about computer vision. Let's think about Denoising, erase such as pepper and salt noise in image. Is it important to do denoise for input image?  someone who agree about to do preprocessing says that noise is unexpected pixel value, so if we denoised noise, than we can get more clear image, so It brings more good performance. someone who disagree about to do preprocessing says 2 reasons.
First, If we can get 100% clear original image without any noise, then compair denoised image and clear original image. It's not totally same image. Also, we can't get without any noise image because of physical reasons.
Second, Deep learning shows better performance when the amount of input data is large. If human intervene to feature extraction, It's not efficient to do with human power. Deep learning can do feature extraction itself, don't need human to feature extraction.
I apolized that I think it's not good example about my question. so, I give another example.
Think about Iris dataset. In Machine learning, We do PCA(or else) and select efficient data(ex: sepal and petal width and length data) and input data to model. But, deep learning don't need select efficient data. If we have nice deep learning model, then we can input whole data.
last example, It is estimated that GPT-3 has been learned with more than 300 billion sentences. I don't think training dataset did pre-processing. Because, sentence might have typo, wrong grammer, slang, abbreviation, etc because human writing. If do preprocessing about typo, wrong grammer, etc then It would have consumed a lot of human labor and costs.
So... Is deep learning really need pre-processing?

How to do backpropagation with argmax?,"
I am attempting to utilize two networks: a classifier and a linear network. Based on the output class of the first network, my goal is to retrieve the corresponding value from the linear network using indexing. For instance, if the first network's output is [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], and the second network's output is [22, 30, 10], it implies that class two is selected, and the final output should be 30. Since this involves backpropagation through argmax, I am using the soft-argmax strategy described in the literature.
Following is the code for soft-argmax
class SoftArgmax1D(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__():
        self.base_index = 0
        self.step_size = 1
        self.softmax = torch.nn.Softmax(dim=1)

    def forward(self, x):
        smax = self.softmax(x*100)
        end_index = self.base_index + x.size()[1] * self.step_size
        indices = torch.arange(start=self.base_index,
                               end=end_index,
                               step=self.step_size)
        return torch.matmul(smax, indices.float()) 

Following is the final architecture:
class CombinedNetwork(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, hidden_size, num_classes):
        super(CombinedNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.classifier_fc1 = nn.Linear(input_size, hidden_size)
        self.classifier_fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_classes)
        self.regression_fc = nn.Linear(input_size, num_classes)
        self.smax = SoftArgmax1D()


    def forward(self, x):
        # Classification branch
        classifier_x = F.relu(self.classifier_fc1(x))
        classifier_x = self.classifier_fc2(classifier_x)
        classification_value = self.smax(classifier_x)
        
        regression_value = self.regression_fc(x)
        
        reg_op = regression_value.gather(1, classification_value.round().unsqueeze(1)).squeeze(1)
        
        return reg_op

The issue arises when indexing the regression_value requires an integer input. However, converting classification_value, which essentially represents the index, to an integer causes the backpropagation to be truncated.
Do you have any suggestions on how to achieve backpropagation for this code?
","['backpropagation', 'pytorch', 'regression', 'softmax']","To back-propagate through non-differentiable operations, without designing a soft approximation for them, is possible to recur to a score gradient estimator:Notice that I've assumes a squared loss between the targets and the predicted values: you can change it as you need. Once the model is trained, you can avoid defining the Categorical and directly index the value by according to the argmax of the logits.NOTE: training may be unstable, if so clip the gradients and rescale the targets (and so values)."

Is there an ANN vector-search index that supports incremental ingestion and deletion of elements?,"
I have looked at a few libraries for ANN search of high dimensional vectors. Although impressive, they come with a huge baggage of fine print. Many of them only support ingesting the vectors in one shot. there is no support for deleting elements from the index. There are a ton of hyperparameters that need to be tuned etc. Is there any index that supports following requirements:

I should be able to add vectors incrementally to the index just like I can do with conventional databases. I will not be having my entire dataset available in advance.
I don't know how many vectors I will be adding. Could be 1000 or could be 1B. I need an index that auto-scales as I add vectors to it. RAM limitation is okay i.e., assume infinite RAM is available for now (bonus if it can handle datasets that cannot fit in RAM).
I don't know how many nearest neighbors I will be querying for at time of building the index. Could be 5 or could be 100. The build step should not ask me to declare in advance the number of NN I will be querying for (looks like ScaNN algorithm asks for this).
I should be able to delete elements from the index. It should be a real deletion leading to freeing up of memory, not marking element with a tombstone.
I don't want to be tuning dozens of hyperparamaters. I can tell the index the length of my embedding. It should derive hyperparameters from it and change them as the index size grows etc.
It should have Python bindings. however, willing to compromise on this somewhat. I can add the bindings myself.

Of course, there are price-performance tradeoffs in these scenarios. It goes without saying that I am not looking for brute-force algorithms and other trivial solutions. I am willing to pay a reasonable price in terms of performance as long as above requirements are met. What is reasonable? lets say I am willing to settle for half of the QPS than what the top-performing algorithm gives but falls short on requirements above.

Does the output of LLM's affect their neural weights?,"
When an LLM creates an output, it seemingly has no way to check if its output was valid.  Therefore it wouldn't be able to back-propagate any changes to the weights is used to create that output.
Right now, I suspect that all weight modification is done by training on input data, as that can (generally) be assumed to be human and valid.
But perhaps it does have some way of checking if its output was good or not, and being modified based off of it.  For instance, there is the thumb up and down button on ChatGPT which could be used for that.
Do LLM's modify their neural weights based off of their own answers?  If so, how?
","['backpropagation', 'chatgpt']","I will base my answer on GPT-2, as most LLMs are not too different in their architecture.The output of the transformer in an LLM is not text or tokens; it is a categorical distribution over the space of next possible tokens.To calculate loss of the transformer, you (commonly) take negative log likelihood. If the training data says the next token was $i$ and the transformer's output was a vector $v$, then we have this loss.
$$L = -\log(v_i)$$
Backpropagating this encourages the transformer to assign higher confidence to the correct token, according to data.Reagarding the 'thumbs up' feature of ChatGPT, this is probably an auxiliary loss. OpenAI is known to use Reinforcement Learning to tune ChatGPT, in addition to the negative log likelihood which would've been used during pre-training. How exactly this is calculated, we don't know; ChatGPT is closed source."

I know that one can use some tool like mathpix that ocr a picture into latex with quite high fidelity.

Should the norm of samples from an untrained denoising diffusion probabilistic model scale with number of diffusion steps?,"
I have implemented a diffusion probabilistic model for the first time, and I am finding some of the model behavior undesirable, but I am not sure if it is normal or the result of an incorrect implementation.
Specifically, when I draw samples from an untrained reverse diffusion process with 20 denoising steps (by sampling from a standard normal distribution and passing the sample sequentially through the denoising kernel), I find that the elements of my final denoised samples have an average absolute value of around 400 (this number increases into the 1000s if I reverse diffuse for more steps). My training data is more like order 1 magnitude (although I am training the model to predict the noise not the noiseless training data), and so this seems problematic for efficiently training a model to me.
Even though the behaviour seems undesirable, it also seems expected from the math. For example, $x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}x_0 + \sqrt{(1-\bar{\alpha}_t)}\epsilon$, and so $x_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}}(x_t - \sqrt{(1-\bar{\alpha}_t)}\epsilon)$, where $x_0$ is the end result of denoising, $\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{t=1}^{T}\alpha_t$, $\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t$, and I am using a cosine noise schedule for the betas (see code at the bottom). Therefore, $x_0$ scales with $\frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}}$, which is equal to 406 when the number of diffusion steps (and $t$) is 20 and equal to 20291 when the number of diffusion steps (and $t$) is 1000.
Is this behavior normal? It seems problematic for efficiently training a model.

To what extent are neural networks stable across multiple training runs?,"
Quick question about LLMS (and gradient descent in general): we search the space of neural networks by gradient descending in order to minimize one explicit function but what seems to be happening is that in the course of minimizing this function, the neural network automatically picks up several other skills (like building a world model...?). I imagine there is a lot of randomness in this process so to what extent are the extra skills picked up ""fixed"".
In other words, if I train models multiple times on the same data using the same loss function, to what extent are the resulting neural networks similar in performance (out of the training set, say)? Does the answer to this question matter much on what the loss function is and how much training has taken place?
Given the proliferation of LLMs with not too dissimilar behaviour, I expect the answer to the above question is positive (maybe in the limit that the training time tends to infinity). But theoretically, this is a little surprising to me that there is an ""almost unique"" minimizer of the given loss function. Do we have a good theoretical framework for explaining this?

Is regression method the best for my case?,"
newbie here. I'm starting to work on a custom model for a very specific task, so I found no pre-trained models for this task so far.
After checking (un)supervised learning approaches I believe that regression will work the best, but could you please take a look and say if there's something better around?
The data is like that:
input1(int) input2(float) input3(int) => output(int)

The set of [inp1, inp2, inp3] is unique and can generate only one output. There are always two and only two such sets that generate the same output (like [2, 5.0, 3] => 0 and [12, -3.0, 1] =>0 too). It's always three inputs in a set (no less, no more), I see no reason to consider there's anything like a label, output varies from +100million to -100 million or even more in the future.
There will be no texts, the data is not time-correlated. The full dataset size is a few hundred million of such sets, if it matters.
So, is regression the best choice here? Any advice on this task for beginner?
Thank you.

Justification for the MCTS backpropagation rule?,"
In Monte Carlo Tree Search, we back-propagate the results of a simulation with reward $R$ to a parent node N like this
$$
V_N \leftarrow \frac{\text{visits}(N)\cdot V_N + R}{\text{visits}(N)+1}
$$
and $V_N$ is our first term in a selector like UCT.
I was looking at alternative MCTS selectors and realised this update rule is not so straightforward as I thought. With it, what we end up with is (for non leaf nodes)
$$
V_N = \sum_{N' \in \text{Children}(N)} \frac{V(N')\cdot\text{visits}(N')}{\text{visits}(N)}
$$
So $V_N$ seems to be the expectation of reward from $N$'s state, if the probability of us ending up at a child node is proportional to the number of times we visited it during tree expansion.
This is completely true if for instance, in the future we acted based on MCTS and did a random number of iterations $\leq \text{visits}(N)$ with $N$ as a root. With a fixed number of iterations though, we would always being doing at least $\geq \text{visits}(N)$ iterations. This implies to me that the child with the most visits (in the present) is overwhelmingly more likely to end up as the actual selected action, than is suggested by our $V_N$ formula.
Sorry if that last part wasn't clear. My point is that the $V_N$ estimate seems ""off-policy"". So it assumes we're going to act in a non-MCTS way. This is somewhat at odds with the case in MCTS where all children are leaves, and so their values are the actual simulation reward expectations.
Since final move selection is based on visit counts and not Q value, this probably doesn't affect the correctness of MCTS much. I wanted to ask if anyone knows if there is a better description of what $V(N)$ actually is, or if there is a good mathematical justification I am not seeing?

How would one normalize observations in off-policy online reinforcement learning?,"
In off-policy algorithms such as DQN, you need to feed your input to a network twice. 1. When inputting into a network for predicting the Q values. 2. When feeding the input from the buffer to the network, to train it. If one doesn't have a standard way of normalizing, this would lead to a difference in the distribution between the inputs for prediction and training, despite having the same values.
My questions follows from the question that I asked over here (I have been told to use a new post for each question). The accepted answer suggested computing running statistics for my inputs. But I doubt that'll work with the problem described above.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'deep-rl', 'dqn', 'off-policy-methods']","(I'll provide a couple of ideas, but I don't think these would fully address the problem.)If you normalize with running statistics (e.g. mean and std) as in the online case, you would get two different results for the same input, say $s$, because it would be normalized with different statistics. I think this would introduce some non-stationarity in the problem, which one usually wants to avoid.One possible solution is to also store the statistics computed at timestep $t$, say $\mu_t$ and $\sigma_t$ such that when you replay a transition $(s_t, a_t, r_t, s'_t, \mu_t,\sigma_t)$ you also have the correct statistics for that timestep: which should avoid the distribution shift.In general, if we assume that the distribution of $s_t$ is stationary i.e. it doesn't change with time, then, in the limit $t\to\infty$ (also assuming unbiased estimators), the statistics $\mu_t$ and $\sigma_t$ will converge to the true mean and std. If so, i.e. when you detect that $\mu_t$ is close to $\mu_{t+1}$ then you can stop storing the stats for each $t$ and only use the latest ones to avoid the extra memory cost. But storing that especially at the beginning of training can help stabilize the agent.Alternatively, you can consider $K$ steps of interaction and keep the stats constant for that number of steps. Then you can either recompute them considering the new $K$ transitions or flush the replay buffer (which probably has the same effect, but reduces sample-efficiency.)"

Fit Q Evaluation in offline reinforcement learning,"
I am working on a PyTorch implementation of Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) (paper), given a dataset $\mathcal D = \left\{ (\mathbf s_i, \mathbf a_i, \mathbf s_i', r_i ) \right\}$ of transitions. I think I have implemented IQL correctly, so now I have a learned policy $\pi$ that takes in an element of the state space $\mathcal S$, and outputs a mean vector and covariance diagonals for a multivariate normal distribution over the action space $\mathcal A = \mathbb R^d$. I would like to evaluate this learned policy $\pi$.
This leads me to investigate off-policy evaluation, specifically Fit Q Evaluation (FQE), given a test dataset of transitions $\mathcal D_e$ as above. I have been reading the offline reinforcement learning paper by Prudencio et al. (link). My problem is that I do not understand how to implement FQE as described in the paper, so I would appreciate guidance for this. Below I quote the relevant part of the paper and ask some questions.

C. Fit Q Evaluation
In fit Q evaluation (FQE), we first train a $Q$-function $Q_{\phi}^{\pi}$ by minimizing the Bellman error under the policy $\pi$. Then, we evaluate the policy by computing the average expected return over the states and actions from $\mathcal D_e$, such that
\begin{align*}
\hat J(\pi) = \mathbb E_{\mathbf s, \mathbf a \sim \mathcal D_e} \left[ Q_{\phi}^{\pi}(\mathbf s, \mathbf a) \right].
\end{align*}

Questions:

Presumably I should use a neural network for $Q_{\phi}^{\pi}$, right?
What is the Bellman error in this context? I have some course notes that give a definition of the Bellman error involving $\max_{\mathbf a'}$, which is not workable since my action space $\mathcal A$ is $\mathbb R^d$ for some $d \in \mathbb Z$.

I have looked at the off-policy evaluation paper by Voloshin et al. (link), which seems to describe FQE in a different way. Specifically,

$\hat Q(\cdot, \theta) = \lim_{k \to \infty} \hat Q_k$, where
\begin{align*}
\hat Q_k &= \min_{\theta} \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i = 1}^N \sum_{t = 0}^{\tilde T} \left( \hat Q_{k - 1}(x_t^i, a_t^i ; \theta) - y_t^i \right)^2\\
y_t^i &\equiv r_t^i + \gamma \mathbb E_{\pi_e} \hat Q_{k - 1}(x_{t + 1}^i, \cdot ; \theta)
\end{align*}

If I understand this correctly, we fit a sequence of neural network $Q$ functions $\hat Q_1, \hat Q_2, \dots$ here, trying to minimize the trajectory-average squared distance between $\hat Q_{k - 1}(x_t^i, a_t^i ; \theta)$ and $y_t^i$. But how do I calculate $y_t^i$ here? I don't know what $\mathbb E_{\pi_e} \hat Q_{k - 1}(x_{t + 1}^i, \cdot ; \theta)$ means.
I appreciate any help.

How does one normalize observations in online reinforcement learning,"
I was wondering how would one normalize observations to a policy without knowing the upper and lower limits of the environment values. A trivial technique would be normalize each observation by its maximum value before inputting it into a policy. However, I feel that doing so, could change the distribution of the data. For instance, let's say we have 2 inputs that we normalize on the fly - [5, 15, 20] and [10, 20, 30] to [0.25, .75, 1] and [0.33, .66 and 1]. Now let's say the true maximum value of the environment is 100. Then the true normalized values should have been [0.05, .15, .20] and [0.1, .20, 0.3]. Wouldn't this adversely affect learning?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'deep-rl', 'model-free-methods']","Alternatively you can compute a running mean, $\mu_t$, and std, $\sigma_t$, of your online data $x_t$, and then standardize at each timestep, $t$:

n &\leftarrow n + 1 \\
\sigma_t &\leftarrow \sigma_{t-1} + (x_t - \mu_t) * (x_t - \mu_{t-1})

How do open source LLMs compare to GPT-4?,"

I have heard that on certain benchmarks they perform close, the same or better than GPT-4, but caveats that they tend to lack the diversity and range of GPT-4, and also fail to be equivalent in ways certain benchmarks or metrics don’t capture fully.
GPT-4 has about 170 trillion parameters, I believe?
It seems like the biggest open source models are all in the billions - like Bloom or the new Falcon 40b.
There are techniques where they refine GPT-4’s output into a smaller amount of training data that supposedly hits all the marks and does just as well; but again, I don’t know if that’s only true under the reductionist of view of a particular benchmark-questionnaire.
So, do open source models actually compete with GPT-4, and why or why not? Is the whole situation a matter of scale, that a commercial venture like OpenAI can foot the massive bill of training a multi-trillion parameter model that no open source AI project can afford, on top of them having expertise in model design, making GPT-4 continually the state-of-the-art? Or is there any open source model that truly can compare in terms of usability?

How is the number of channels in a convolutional layer shrinked or expanded?,"
I know in order to shrink or expand the number of channels a 1x1 convolution is performed.
I need to clarify the following: is the 1x1 convolution(s) just a matrix multiplication between the image with shape (hw, 3) (RGB) and a matrix that holds the learnable weights with shape (3, 1)? Which will result in a new matrix of shape (hw, 1) (in this case the number of channels shrunk from 3 to 1).
If the above is correct, what happens under the hood of a NN framework, such as PyTorch, when the number of input channels is equal to the number of output channels? Does a matrix multiplication take place between the input (h*w, 3) and a matrix with learnable weights (num_channels, num_channels)? Doesn't this introduce unnecessary (and unwanted) operations?

Why doesn't Reward Normalization subtract the mean?,"
I want to introduce Reward Normalization for my current RL project. For this, I looked at how other libraries implemented this functionality. I found the following implementation:
https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/wrappers/normalize.py
Looking at the reward normalization itself :
def normalize(self, rews):
    """"""Normalizes the rewards with the running mean rewards and their variance.""""""
    self.return_rms.update(self.returns)
    return rews / np.sqrt(self.return_rms.var + self.epsilon)

I do not understand why we don't substract the mean from the rewards? Especially, since in the Observation Normalization, this substraction is present:
def normalize(self, obs):
    """"""Normalises the observation using the running mean and variance of the observations.""""""
    self.obs_rms.update(obs)
    return (obs - self.obs_rms.mean) / np.sqrt(self.obs_rms.var + self.epsilon)

I assume there must be a good reason for this, but I could not figure it out yet.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'reward-design']","Reward normalisation is constrained by the need to not change the problem definition. The optimal policy should be the same with or without reward normalisation. The intended improvement is to make it easier to converge on the right policy, and possibly - as in DQN Atari paper - to allow the use of the same hyperparameters elsewhere.A change to reward ratios could change the problem definition. Consider an environment where the agent could choose between receiving a reward of +1 three times or a reward of +2 once, due to the rewards being associated with exclusive pathways. Offset these rewards towards zero then the optimal choice will change.A change of sign to rewards, when they become centered around zero, can also change what is optimal. This can change things so much that an agent will prefer to end an episode instead of completing a task as originally described in the problem definition.These problems don't always occur, but due to the risk, general purpose reward normalisation will not offset, just scale."

With enough training data, the model could potentially recognize what a tree is and the fact that only part of it is in the image and infer that it is cropped.Hypothetically, if we take this a step further, and say the model can recognize that if an object in the foreground is not fully contained in the image, then the image is cropped. In this case, the model can generalize to new data, but only if there's a sufficiently large object in the foreground.Now let's consider some potential failure modes, what if it's a picture of many trees? How can you tell that it's cropped? When you think about this, there's many cases where a model could fail, especially if it's a subtle crop. In the set of images below, the one on the left is the original, the middle is a subtle crop on all sides, and the right is a regular crop:
This idea could be tested on any image dataset, where images are either unchanged or cropped and resized on the fly with an appropriate label corresponding to uncropped or cropped. It would be interesting to see if the model is just obtaining performance via guessing or if it's actually learning characteristics of cropped images."
Continuous Pathfinding for 3D Complex Environments,"
I'm the creator of an autonomous bot referred to as SwarmBot for Minecraft. One of SwarmBot's core features is its parkouring ability. Despite being relatively effective, there are instances where the current algorithm (block-discretized A*) fails to ensure that the bot operates as intended. For certain complex jumps, such as the neo-jump that is shown below, the bot lacks the required finesse to pull off.

Neo jumps pose a unique hurdle as the jumping sequence does not entail the bot looking towards the next target block. Instead, it requires the bot to jump around a block by facing away from the next intended block before changing directions.
Now, I am trying another approach—discretizing based on game ticks, with consequent nodes based on the player-pressed keys. The image below shows A* without a heuristic trying to find a path over a course where the bot can turn/jump when it is on the ground. Each green circle is a block, and each black pixel is an expanded node.

Clearly, this is not feasible. Turns are tried at lowest g-scores (since there is no heuristic), and I cannot think of a good consistent & admissible heuristic to try turning furthest down the chain. Perhaps I do not need a consistent nor admissible heuristic. I am only trying to find good paths, not optimal ones. I have also tried negative costs for certain nodes instead of a heuristic, which seems better, but this could cause issues as I could get a path of infinite length if conditions are just right.
What are some recommendations for this problem? It looks like I want to do something like is demonstrated in this Udacity video on A* for their cars, but I have a hard time finding why theirs looks much more like a sparse tree than mine. Perhaps they are using something more akin to Rapidly exploring random tree. Is this a path that makes sense to go down? Would you recommend any other papers?

Inquiry about utilising AI in CNC machining path generation,"
I will begin by describing a situation. I work in laser machining control company. The essence of the problem, to which I would like to try to apply AI based tool is this:
Say I have a analytically described trajectory in 3D space. It can consist of lines, arcs, circles, NURB curves etc, anything that can be parametricaly described. I have a machine which can move at limited speed, limited acceleration, limited Jerk. In short, a machine which has real kinematic limits. I would like that machine to follow the parametric curve at some prescribed speed. As machine has real kinematic limits, it wont be able to follow trajectory exactly. For example, one cannot execute continuous corner motion. The machine should either stop, change direction of movement, and start moving again, or it can ""smooth"" the corned, by moving in a curve some distance $d$ away from the prescribed parametric curve. If $d$ is smaller then some prescribed constant, I am ok with that.
So let me restate the problem. I have a corridor in 3D Euclidean space which has a analytical description. I would like my magical AI tool to generate a parametric curve in that corridor which would satisfy some prescribed analytical constrains and minimize some analytical parameters.
EDIT: Maybe it could be helpful to imagine it as a game. Say it is a race game in space. The track is a round corridor in a 3D space. My goal is to stay as close to the middle of the corridor as possible. My motion is governed by some equation and objective and analytical limitations. At any point, I can change my motion equation, to adapt to the trajectory of corridor. Another rule is, that I would like to make as little of those changes of trajectory as possible. I want to find out, when I should make those choices to change my motion and how should I change my motion. The winner is the one who stayed as close to the middle as possible and who used as little changes of motion as possible. If at any point I would end up being outside the corridor, it's and instant loose
Could such tool be created? How difficult it would be? How efficient and reliable such tool could be? How one should start making such tool? How one should ensure its reliability? Is anyone aware of work which was already be done in this field?

Why does the critic of WGAN-GP run more steps than the generator?,"
As noted in the paper introducing WGAN-GP (see the pseudo-code), for each minibatch of data, the generator's weights are updated only once, and the critic (or discriminator) is updated multiple times. This is also evident from the Keras implementation. However, normal GANs update both the generator and the discriminator only once per batch, as is demonstrated in the TensorFlow implementation. Why this difference?
","['deep-learning', 'generative-adversarial-networks']","Balancing the training of the generator and the critic is essential for high-quality GANs. If either the generator or the discriminator overpowers the other, the model will not converge to a satisfactory state.Balancing the generator and the discriminator can be done in many different ways. For example, you could make the generator bigger, giving it more computational capacity, but potentially slowing down its convergence because there are more parameters to tune.The way you state, to update either the generator or the discriminator more than the other, is another way of trying to achieve such a balance. Although some tutorials of normal GANs might not show that this balancing is necessary (as they try to make the tutorial as easy as possible), balancing a traditional GAN by training one module more than the other is very common.With WGAN-GP, we penalize the discriminator which hence learns less fast. As a result, the assumption is that we need to train it more to stay in balance. Consequently, the paper proposes the balancing hyperparameter that it does.Concluding, this balancing parameter can also be added to normal GANs, or any GAN for that matter. The paper proposes a hyperparameter setting indicative for their test results. However, please play around with it if you want to apply it for your specific application. I've trained GANs both with training the generator 10x more than the discriminator and also the other way around. There is no golden rule for this kind of stuff."
A technique to show what tokens are relatively predicted by an LLM,"
I’m picturing a technique where you can see what an LLM is likely to respond with, which updates in real time.
It’s a bit trippy, but it’s like GitHub Copilot, in that there is predicted text while you type, but it’s predicting what an LLM would say in response.
It updates its prediction for any change in word of your current input.
So if I just type the word “The”, the prediction might show the average of a bunch of repeated LLM responses, maybe “I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that, could you please ask again?” or something.
Like Google Translate, maybe there are 3 main variations on what answers you’re expecting, so there’s the main one and the alternatives listed below it.
Now when you continue typing, to “The book”, the predicted responses update.
However, it shows in relative terms what changed the most by the addition of the token “book”, so you can see / get a sense for specifically how that token changes the model’s “understanding”, in that context.
For example, you could color-code or size-code words to show which words appear in the predicted output which are more unique or distinctive. Like by adding “book” into the input context window, the output might indicate the presence of highly unique tokens in the predicted output, like “library”, “read”, etc.
There is a lot you could do with this.
I see it as maybe being based on a kind of constructed “calculus” of LLM inputs and outputs.
You have to find a way to define the average of any N strings. If the average of two strings is judged highly similar, they can be treated (in that context) as synonyms; if the average is highly different, they are two different variations of output you might expect.
The average helps you determine which tokens are “unique” - because they are or are not in some average of N output strings.
Can anyone suggest how you could construct that average function?
One way would involve adding and subtracting common words between two sentences.
Another would be using an LLM to judge how similar two sentences are; ie an LLM-native approach where the LLM provides all the functions for assessing the LLMs own output.

Why is my super-computer scale PPO not scaling well?,"
Hi I basically have PPO as implemented in stable-baselines3 and so far it is not scaling well at all which is very concerning. The basic parallelism strategy is very similar to OpenAI five's training strategy: each worker has PPO with batch size 4096, parallel environment execution & 1 training step (to avoid stale gradients) & 4 steps per environment. Then each worker averages its weight updates then the loop repeats.
Why would this setup fail to scale across 1000's of cores? I've been for example training this on BiPedalWalker-Hardcore-v3, and it asymptotes at about 0 reward (up from -90).
P.S. if this is not enough information, then I'll add more.

How do we get from types of activation functions to fitting lines to our data?,"
I'm completely new to AI and admittedly have never been good at math (also please excuse me if I use the wrong terminology). Despite this, I'm trying wrap my head around activation functions and how they are used by a neural network to fit a line to a set of data.
I understand the purpose of an activation function, but what I'm struggling with is how we go from deciding which type of activation function to use for each neuron to actually fitting a line to our data.
In an attempt to illustrate this question, here is a YouTube video which demonstrates how a fitted line would change as data is passed through a neural network using various types of activation functions.
At the moment, it just seems like magic that we pass data through and depending on which type of activation function being used the line somehow changes in various ways and I have no idea why it's doing what it's doing.
Any help with this or guidance regarding what knowledge gaps I might have that are preventing me from understanding this would be greatly appreciated! My goal in all in asking this is to be able to do the math by hand in a much smaller network to demonstrate that I understand what's happening behind the scenes.

What is better: train a model from scratch on your own data vs. fine-tune pretrained model?,"
Problem: I am interested in building a Q&A engine on top of my private data. I am only interested in asking questions related to my data.
Options:

I train a model from scratch on my own data
I pick a pretrained large language model and fine-tune it on my data

With option 1, I don't expect to train a model with billions of parameters. I understand training from scratch is expensive and time-consuming but I am going to use a much smaller parameter model in that case. For sake of argument, quoting [1]

Falcon-7B and Falcon-40B have been trained on 1.5 trillion and 1 trillion tokens respectively,

so if I have 1 billion tokens in my dataset, I will train a model with 40M parameters.
Is there some objective answer / study done as to which option turns out better?
For completeness, option 2 is something I have tried but I did not get any decrease in my training loss i.e., the fine-tuning was a no-op. I used gpt2 pretrained model with 130M parameters or so and my dataset had about 600 training examples in it. # of tokens = 600 * 1024. any pointers whether this (i.e., fine-tuning made no difference) is to be expected and why would also be appreciated.

Why does HER not work with on-policy RL algorithms?,"
I'm wondering because I don't appreciate what is wrong with just applying HER to an otherwise on-policy algorithm? Like if we do that will the training stability just fall apart? And if so why? My understanding is that on-policy is just a category created by humans meaning that ""the default algorithm doesn't do off-policy optimization"". But why does that prohibit adding off-policy elements?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'off-policy-methods', 'on-policy-methods', 'hindsight-experience-replay']","On policy algorithms contain policy and/or value update calculations that assume data was generated by the current policy. Breaking that assumption will cause them to miscalculate, or not function at all without some kind of intervention.As an example SARSA has the TD target (new estimate for $q(S_t,A_t)$) of:$$R_{t+1} + \gamma q(S_{t+1},A_{t+1})$$The main problem here is the value of $A_{t+1}$ (there's a couple of minor issues with $S_t, A_t$ as well, but those also apply to off policy and are why you usually want your behaviour policy to be close to the target policy).In an experience replay table you will have historic data from when the policy was different. So the value of $A_{t+1}$ that might be stored may not be the one that the current policy would take. Learning from that action would skew the value table to learning about whatever policy has just been sampled, instead of more accurately improve knowledge of the current policy.To fix this, you could resample the action choice, or even use an expected q value across all actions that SARSA could currently take. That fixes things, but actually it also changes your method to off-policy Expected SARSA . . .Similar issues apply to using experience replay tables with other on policy methods. They become inaccurate if used naively, and if you fix the issues with that, you reinvent off-policy methods (when possible, not all on policy methods have an off policy equivalent)"

For instance,

I see a spike in CPU usage when I run inference. What causes it?
If I have multiple CPUs, and run multiple inference tasks simultaneously, will they be parallelized?
Does it make sense to use something like joblib for inference? Given that I am loading the model into GPU.

How does one decide the probability distribution for an LLM during RLHF?,"
I was looking into how KL divergence is used in LLMs to prevent reward hacking within the course Generative AI with LLMs on Coursera (if this redirects to the homepage, the article is on week 3). As mentioned before, they talk about the use of KL divergence as a penalty against the model generating text that makes no sense to the original prompt but maximises the reward against the 3Hs (or whichever benchmark is used).
However, from what I've seen on KL divergence, it requires 2 probability distributions (in this case, the original LLM and the RLHF trained LLM). However what probability distribution is used in this case? This is considering that the entire prompt is generated before the metrics can be evaluated.

What's the architecture and size of neural-network-based reward models as used in reinforcement learning by human feedback,"
My rough understanding of RLHF as used for ChatGPT in a nutshell is this:

A reward model is trained using comparisons of different responses
to the same prompt. Human trainers rank these responses based on
quality.

The reward model is a neural network that learns to predict these
human rankings. It essentially learns the ""policy"" that human
trainers use to rank responses.

An initial policy, which is a language model, is fine-tuned using
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with the reward model providing
the reward signal. This process is iterative, with the policy and
reward model being updated alternately.

The policy is then used to generate responses to prompts. The reward
model assesses these responses and provides a reward signal, which
is used to further fine-tune the policy, i.e. the language model.


My main question is the first one, the others are just for giving context:

1. What's the architecture and size of the neural-network-based reward model?

Is it pretrained, too? Is it possibly another pretrained (foundational) language model?

By how many samples labelled by human trainers is the reward model trained?

By how many prompts and rewarded completions is the language model trained later? (Which prompts, by the way?)



These numbers I'd like to compare with the numbers of pretrained ChatGPT:

Transformer-based ChatGPT has 175 billion weights.

It was pretrained on 500 GB of text data, distributed over an unknown number of ""documents"" (from single tweets to the Holy Bible) with roughly 500B tokens over all. During training ChatGPT was exposed to a multiple of 500B samples (assuming that all 500B tokens were used for training).


I assume that during RLHF foundational ChatGPT was exposed to a much smaller number of prompts to complete (and to be rewarded).

For example,For the reward models and
value functions, the unembedding layer of the original model is replaced with a projection layer
to output a scalar value.The final reward model was initialized from a 6B GPT-3 model that was fine-tuned on a variety of
public NLP datasets (ARC, BoolQ, CoQA, DROP, MultiNLI, OpenBookQA, QuAC, RACE, and

Pyramid Vision Transformer V2: Complexity of spacial reduction attention (SRA),"
I'm currently reading the paper PVT v2: Improved Baselines with Pyramid Vision Transformer, where the authors improve a transformer architecture that can be used as a backbone for multiple computer vision tasks such as classification, object detection, and image segmentation. In section 3.2 of the paper, they propose an approach to further reduce the complexity of the attention operation by computationally reducing the size of the inputs K and V to the attention operation.

First, to reduce the high computational cost caused by
attention operations, we propose linear spatial reduction attention layer
Different from
SRA, which uses convolutions for spatial reduction, linear
SRA uses average pooling to reduce the spatial dimension
(i.e., $h\times w$) to a fixed size (i.e., $P\times P$) before the attention
operation. So linear SRA enjoys linear computational
and memory costs like a convolutional layer. Specifically,
given an input of size $h\times w\times c$, the complexity of SRA and
linear SRA is:
\begin{gathered}
\Omega(\text { SRA })=\frac{2 h^2 w^2 c}{R^2}+h w c^2 R^2, \\
\Omega(\text { Linear SRA })=2 h w P^2 c,
\end{gathered}

Now, I get the idea behind the minimal complexity of Linear SRA: if we double $h,w$, or $c$, the number of times we would do average pooling would also double, and the 2 is there since we operate on $K$ and $V$. I don't see how they derived the complexity for SRA; however, maybe someone familiar with at least the original paper where SRA was proposed could enlighten me. Sadly, the authors haven't answered two similar questions raised in the corresponding GitHub repo.

Example: https://huggingface.co/google/umt5-base

Note: UMT5 was only pre-trained on mC4 excluding any supervised training. Therefore, this model has to be fine-tuned before it is useable on a downstream task.

The model was pre-trained on a whole lot of languages. Let's suppose I devise a fine-tuning dataset to classify sentences (like user feedback). But due to resource constraints, only a few languages will be included. In my fine-tuned task, will the model be able to generalize to languages it was pre-trained, but not fine-tuned on?
","['natural-language-processing', 'transformer', 'fine-tuning']","The short answer: Very unlikely.The extended answer: If you fine-tune a model, it becomes specialized for the type of data you fine-tune it on but you trade in some of its generalization capabilities. In your particular example, that means that your model becomes very attuned to user feedback and performs very highly on user feedback in the languages it has seen during training. It looses both its capabilities for more general texts and other languages from pre-training. It will perform lower on general texts and significantly lower on user feedback in different languages from your training set.To address this problem, you need something called domain adaptation or transfer learning. Domain adaptation means you train your model on a domain dataset, e.g. your user feedback dataset in a small range of languages, and then adapt/transfer it to your actual target dataset. See an example below:There are different approaches for this. Some adapt the data, others prefer to transfer the model. There is a lot of research in this area.

I've also had EE classes on signal processing, so I'm familiar with the Fourier transform and the like.  So I have a general idea of how different algorithms can, for lack of a better term, ""pick up on"" patterns in the training data and make predictions on the testing data, which will hopefully be reasonably accurate.  And I have a general idea of how signals can be represented as discrete binary sequences which could then be used to train an ML model.
What I want to know is, what sorts of patterns, in the mathematical sense, in audio recordings of speech specifically, do these algorithms find?  e.g., What allows the Alexa app to both recognize when I'm speaking vs when it's my grandma speaking, and yet still understand the same commands from both of us?  What, mathematically, makes, e.g., a recording of me saying ""Alexa play music"" both distinguishable from a recording of a different person saying the same command, and yet still recognizably contain the same information of the command?

",['transformer'],"The GPT models (as manifested using the decoder block in the original Transformer architecture) are not generating the embedding.  However, the weights from the GPT are being used as the initial weights in a new model, dubbed CPT [1], that can create embeddings.The key lies in Contrastive Modeling techniques - acquire pair data and train a new model to minimize loss on the known pairs. Look at the CLIP model for a good review of contrastive loss.  The CLIP model embeds the text and image into the same vector space. Thus, CLIP and contrastive models know how to create embeddings.Pair data, luckily, is prevalent on the web and easy to acquire:  [image, caption], [docstring, code], [podcast titles, podcast descriptions], etc.One key ingredient: you get way better results when you start with an initialized pre-trained model. That's where the GPT leverage comes in.  They are using the GPT models (at various sizes like Ada, Babbage, Curie, DaVinci...) as the initial weights on a new constrastive model.Thus, the formula is:The resulting model is what OpenAI calls a ""cpt"" model.It's unclear how well these contrastive loss embedding models work compared to a more traditional encoder-based LLM block (like universal-sentence-encode).

Dataflow is bare minimum: qnn.conv2d_transpose -> nn.bias_add -> qnn.requantize 
Codegen is based on regular conv2d (which is proven to work) while changing output shape, function calls etc.
Is there a difference in the way quantization works regarding transposed/regular convolutions? I'm using the TFLite frontend with int8 weights, inputs and outputs.
Gemmini convolutions fuse qnn.conv2d, nn.bias_add and qnn.requantize into a single function (see: Gemmini - A note about quantization). But since calculating the new bias should not be affected by padding/dilation, I don't suspect the issue here.
Any ideas appreciated. Thanks!

"If not chosen all the data in the train partition, is it still k-fold cross validation?","
I have a dataset of 900 images, distributed across 6 classes, with 150 images per class. To develop a classifier and assess its performance, I will utilize k-fold cross-validation. In this case, I will employ 3-fold cross-validation.
For each fold, I will allocate 70% of the data for training purposes, leaving the remaining 30% for testing. Consequently, within the training partition, there will be 105 images per class. However, during the training phase, I will only select 20 images per class to train the model. When evaluating the model, I will assess its performance on the entire test partition.
To report the overall performance of the model, I will calculate the average test accuracy across the 3 folds and present this averaged accuracy as the final performance metric.

"LSTM Ensemble: Combine low, mid, and high frequency time series data","
I am trying to implement time series classification, but I am struggling a bit with the fact that my multivariate data has mixed frequencies. I have about 10 variables that are updated every minute, 10 features that are updated every 2-3 hours, and some low frequency variables that are updated every day.
The prediction frequency should be quite high at 15 minutes. So the obvious way might be to group variables within 15 minute intervals. However, this works well for the high frequency variables that occur each minute, but not for the low frequency as within 15 minutes no new values occur.
Maybe you know something that could help me and give me some sort of starting point?
I had an idea, but I have never seen such an approach in practice. For the medium and low frequency variables, could we just go back 3h and 1 day respectively, starting from the time of prediction, and aggregate the data in that interval. One could then form several of these packages. However, this would mean that one could recalculate the input sequence for each time point and not simply send a new data point as input into the model which has retained its state from the previous inputs.
Another idea would be to simply pass in the last raw values of the variables along with some timestamp when they occured. However, I'm a bit afraid that the timestamp introduce some unwanted correlation.

"Ignoring aspects of text embeddings, e.g. making the embedding topic-agnostic","
Imagine a large set of text embeddings (e.g. by OpenAI model), created on user inputs in a natural language interface (e.g. a semantic search app), which we want to cluster on some ""non-topic aspect"" of the text (e.g. clarity of query). As expected, clustering by default results in different topics being grouped together.
What are the best practices to ignore the topics when clustering if we define topics as whatever some dimensionality reduction process favours (e.g. the clusters we get initially)?
Alternatively, is there some documented/researched process of training additional models on top of these embeddings (or adding layers to existing models) to boost these different aspects of the embedded text, or at least to achieve this ""blindness"" to certain aspects of the embedding (with some additional train data)?
Of course, I am assuming that these other aspects are also contained in the embedding, they are just less expressed.

How to introduce variation between instances of a neural network?,"
What are some good ways to introduce variation between instances of a neural network?
I've heard about training each instance on different data, with the same data in a different order, through bagging, by randomising each instance's initial weights, or by altering the structure of the network (e.g. changing the activation functions or the number of nodes in each of the hidden layers).

Several kinds of edges in a GNN,"
I have an existing implementation (written by somebody else) of an MPNN using the graph_nets library. The graph net is based on a tree, but has 4 times as many edges: if U is the parent of V and R is the root of the tree, then the graph net has the edges (U, V), (V, U), (R, V) and (V, R).
I think it makes sense to have a separate MLP for each kind of edge. So I would have for each edge a single feature, whose value is an integer from 0 to 3, and the edge function would select one of 4 MLPs and apply it.
Does this make sense? Is there a way to implement this with graph_nets? How?

Regarding the use of Time2Vec as positional encoding for Timeseries Transformer,"
Although the transformer architecture was originally designed for NLP, there exists several articles and papers that attempt to apply the same architecture for numerical timeseries classification. These are some notable examples:

https://towardsdatascience.com/the-time-series-transformer-2a521a0efad3
https://towardsdatascience.com/time2vec-for-time-series-features-encoding-a03a4f3f937e
https://towardsdatascience.com/stock-predictions-with-state-of-the-art-transformer-and-time-embeddings-3a4485237de6

Based on the above, it seems that the usage of time2vec for positional encoding is prevalent. However, my concern is that all these articles use timeseries values as inputs to time2vec (e.g., prices or sales) rather thanthe actual temporal information (i.e., a time index t=0,1,2,3..). This seems problematic as:

This is not a positional encoding, but an enrichment of feature representation
Even the word2vec paper (If I understood it correctly) mentions that it is designed to work on a time related feature

Several persons have asked similar questions in other sites, for example this is taken from the first article:

Why is the feature being encoded in time2Vec and not the actual time
index? How does encoding the feature provide positional encoding?

Yet, I was not able to find any explanations. So, can someone please resolve this? Is this design approach a widespread misinterpretation of positional encoding?
Note: Even if time2vec is applied on a time index, it should probably be a global time index created before batching/windowing the data, because the local time index within the batch is arbitrary.

"Can I train an agent with DQN, avoiding obstacles and still finding the optimal path to finish the task?","
The agent is supposed to visit specific locations (which is also different each time) and it may encounters obstacles. The goal is to visit those locations with the shortest path possible without hitting obstacles. Those locations that need to be visited are fruits that requires the agent to fertilize them. There are different fruits but the agent only have to fertilize specific types. The only available information to the agent is its current location and the type of the fruits to be fertilized. It is possible to know the location of the target crops but not the obstacle beforehand. The fixed information in each episode is the size of the field/grid-world, the type and locations of the fruits, the initial state of the agent.
My question is  - can I train the agent with a DQN algorithm, avoiding obstacles and still finding the optimal path to finish the task?

Can DQN find optimal path while avoiding random obstacles?,"
Can an agent trained with a DQN algorithm in a grid world, avoid obstacles (randomly appearing during the run time) and still find the optimal path to finish a task? The agent is supposed to visit specific locations (which is also different each time) and it may encounters obstacles. The goal is to visit those locations with the shortest path possible.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'dqn', 'robotics']","Yes, DQN can do this, but if you want optimal behaviour, you will not be able to use a really simple representation of the state, with only the position of the agent tracked. In order to predict expected returns, and take an optimal path, the agent needs to be told somehow where these obstacles are.In this kind of scenario it is common to use some ""image"" of the grid that the agent is navigating, with walls, obstacles and the agent changing the value at the grid point they are occupying. Then the agent can use a convolutional neurtal network (CNN) to approximate Q values. You don't have to do this, any representation that tracks all changeable positions between episodes should work. However, the grid view of the environment is reasonably generic, and would cover many possible versions of the environment (e.g. you can change number of obstacles, add moving obstacles and other grid elements, all using a similar representation and starting agent model).The training session will need to include new random locations on each episode, so that the agent can learn to generalise how it should deal with them. It will take longer for the agent to learn this generalisation, than if it learned a static maze."
How are Target Values Generated in Alpha Zero Architecture,"
I am a little confused as to how the target values are generated to train the neural network with the Alpha Zero architecture(in specific to a chess game). I understand how the improved policy is generated from the number visits to each child node. In a lot of different sources they say that a training sample is generated by keeping track of (state, policy,_) where _ is the eventual win or loss that occurs in the game. This would mean that if white eventually won the game, every single state that white had in the Monte Carlo Tree would receive a value of +1. Isn't this very counter intuitive since there were clearly suboptimal moves that white chose not to take(for example moving a queen out into direct danger to be captured) but these states will still be marked with a +1. Wouldn't it make more sense to just label the state/moves that directly led to the win(traversing up the tree) instead of marking every considered state based on the outcome of one path.
Another question I had was instead of training the values of every state on the eventual win or loss +1/-1, would it not make more sense to train it against the final Wins/Visits value that was calculated when conducting simulations on the tree. Wouldn't Wins/Visits be a much more representative for the average value of the state instead of declaring it to be completely a +1 or -1 since there are probably particular subbranches that could result in a win and some that could result in a loss. Sure the target values in the beginning of training would be very inaccurate, but as the network gets more experience with states right before the end of the game, the accuracy of the value predictions would improve upwards the tree.

"When using (s,a,r,s') to train networks could the Q network be adjusting to a suboptimal r?","
My question here is that whenever you take an experience from the experience buffer (s,a,r,s') and you input r into r+yMAXQ(s',a') to get the loss. What if the r from that experience (s,a,r,s') is not the highest possible reward you can get in that state so then when you are calculating the loss and updating the weights isn't it training the network to pick a reward that isn't the maximum possible reward in that state. I realize it is also taking the target estimate into account as well when adjust the weights buy I am talking about specifically the r.
","['neural-networks', 'reinforcement-learning', 'deep-learning', 'deep-rl', 'dqn']","In reinforcement learning, you do not usually wish to train an agent to learn to take actions for maximising the highest possible reward. Instead you wish to train the agent to take actions that maximise the expected reward. An optimal agent is one that, on average, gains the most reward. It is not one that relies on being lucky to score the highest possible reward.As such, any reward experienced is assumed to be a fair sample of one of the possible rewards received when taking action $a$ in state $s$. Provided there is no hidden state, and thus the Markov property holds, and the agent samples $s, a$ enough times to determine the expected reward from that combination, then this means the agent's estimates will converge towards the true expected action values.As a simple example, if the reward from taking action $a_1$ in state $s_1$ was $-1$ most of the time, but 5% of the time it was $+10$, and the reward from taking action $a_2$ in the same state was always $+1$, and both action choices transitioned to state $s_2$, then action $a_2$ should be considered a more optimal choice than action $a_1$. Despite the fact that it is possible to get a higher reward in $a_1$, the higher expected reward from $a_2$ is a better choice.If the agent is allowed to know the true expected immediated reward from $s, a$, the you could use that instead of using the sampled values. You should not use the maximum observed reward so far to update the agent, because that is a biased measure of the expected reward."
Deep Q Networks v Monte Carlo Tree Search in Alpha Zero,"
Recently I've been studying how Deep Q Networks work, and as I was reading I just assumed that game engines like Alpha Zero use Deep Q Learning to choose actions. But as I was reading the Alpha Zero papers and I saw that they were using Monte Carlo Tree Search with a Neural network in the back to provide policy and value predictions. My question is why didn't the Alpha zero team use a deep Q learning approach if it is capable of building complex representations of the state. What are the advantages to using a Tree search algorithm for this particular circumstance and in general what are the different situations where one would prefer to use Deep Q learning and where one would go for a Monte Carlo Tree approach.
My current theory is that Deep Q Learning approaches require dense reward environments and games like chess don't really place emphasis on mid game rewards. The only thing that matters is to win the game whether by a lot or a little.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'dqn', 'monte-carlo-tree-search', 'alphazero']","DQN and MCTS (+ NNs) are algorithms of two distinct RL flavors:DQN is able to do a 1-step lookahead in the future by looking at the action-value of the next state-action pair, i.e. $Q(s',a')$ - there are also extensions to $n$-step learning, anyway $n$ is relatively small (because that whould increase variance a lot) - instead MCTS can explore the full tree of interaction (where you have all the possible state-action combinations) until termination of the episode. Indeed, exploring the full tree is always impractical and MCTS does this in a randomized fashion (thus the name Monte Carlo) to approximate the value.AlphaGo/Zero uses also a value network to provide a further estimate of the next state value, $V(s')$, which is combined with the classical notion of value provided by MCTS itself, then it has also a policy network that is learned to predict the actions found useful by MCTS.My current theory is that Deep Q Learning approaches require dense reward environments and games like chess don't really place emphasis on mid game rewards.Partially true, I mean exploration technique and reward shaping can help with sparse rewards, but the point is that having access to the underlying model makes everything easier to learn. Consider that DQN has to implicitly learn the model (actually it learns an association between state-action and value), and after learning it cannot change its beliefs if the state distribution shifts for example. Instead, MCTS can even adapt to changing distributions because you plan your action in advance, so without experiencing the actual environment.My question is why didn't the Alpha zero team use a deep Q learning approach if it is capable of building complex representations of the state.Their value network can, in principle, learn complex representations of the state too. It is used as a heuristic to improve the search of MCTS. In principle, I think is possibile to use a Q-network too but one has to change the heuristic that MCTS follows to judge actions which guides the exploration of the game tree."
Relation between Batch Size and Micro Batch Size,"
In distributed training of large models (pipeline parallelism), a mini batch of training samples is divided into n-micro batches. Each device performs forward and backward passes for a micro batch.
What is the relation between Batch Size, Micro Batch Size, Gradient Accumulation (usually: batch size/micro batch size) in relation to no of GPUs as well as GPU size?
I understand that a micro-batch size is bounded by the GPU capacity, increasing it may lead to OOM error. Let suppose, for two GPU of 40GB capacity, we can use a max micro-batch size of 4 and we are using the batch size of 128. Next, we want to increase the count of GPU to 8 (each 40GB capacity). What is the best way to speed up. Whether increasing the batch-size will help? Or the global batch size has very subtle/no effect on the training time (only overhead is synchronization) in distributed training.

"Will the target network, which is less trained than the normal network, output inferior estimates?","
I'm having some trouble understanding some parts of the usage of target networks. 
I get that having the same network predict the state/action/advantage values for both the current networks can lead to instability. 
Based on my understanding, the intuition behind 1-step TD error that going a step into the future will give you a better estimate, that can then be used to update your original state/action/advantage value.
However, if you use a target network, which is less trained than the normal net — especially at early stages of the training — wouldn't the state/action/advantage value be updating towards an inferior estimate?
I've tried implementing DQNs and DDPGs on Cartpole, and I've found that the algorithms fail to converge when target networks are used, but work fine when those target networks are removed. 
","['reinforcement-learning', 'q-learning', 'dqn', 'deep-rl']","However, if you use a target network, which is less trained than the normal net — especially at early stages of the training — wouldn't the state/action/advantage value be updating towards an inferior estimate?Possibly, but a critical part of stability of TD learning with function approximation when adding a target network is that any updates will be consistent in the short term.Consider that with a single network, the TD target calculation will also be biased (and by the same amounts on the first few passes), but they will not be consistent. Each learning update shifts the estimates by a value that is biased. Problems occur with stability when instead of the bias decaying over time due to real data from each step, that the bias amount is enough to form a positive feedback loop. As a concrete example, suppose an initial random network calculating $\hat{q}(s,a,\theta)$ whereThe NN initially, predicts 5.0 for $\hat{q}(s,a,\theta)$ and 7.0 for $\text{max}_{a'}\hat{q}(s',a',\theta)$. We also have a learning network using parameters $\theta$ that change on each learning update. We have a frozen copy of the initial network using parameter $\bar{\theta}$ We have some learning rate $\alpha$ that for arguments sake we say reduces error in this case by 50% each time it sees this example.The approximation process in the NN means that $\hat{q}(s,a,\theta)$ and $\text{max}_{a'}\hat{q}(s',a',\theta)$ are linked. This is a real feature of neural networks, but hard to model as it evolves over time. Let's say that with the initial setup that any learning of $\hat{q}(s,a,\theta)$ in isolation will make $\text{max}_{a'}\hat{q}(s',a',\theta)$ change towards $\hat{q}(s,a,\theta)$ by a 50% step. These steps sizes are not that important, they could be just 1% and the problem still occurs.To really trigger the problem I want to show, let's say that these single steps are occurring far enough away from the end of an episode, or other moderating feedback, that we effectively get a few hundred visits to our $(s,a)$ pair without impact from other items (in fact it is likely that many will be going through the same issues)Without the target network, the first TD target is $1.0 + 7.0 = 8.0$. After update $\hat{q}(s,a,\theta) = 6.5$ and $\text{max}_{a'}\hat{q}(s',a',\theta)$ = 6.75$. This looks good, right? Getting closer to the real values . . . but keep going . . . the next updates work like this:Again, this looks OK? But let's come back to it after 100 [isolated, so a bit fake] iterations:This has overshot, and both values are increasing exponentially. The initial neural network bias is caught in a positive feedback loop.Now if we use the target network that always predicts 7.0, what happens is what you expect. After 100 iterations we have:These values are still incorrect, but the updates have made a more conservative and stable step towards the correct values. Note the second value is what the learning network would predict for $\text{max}_{a'}\hat{q}(s',a',\theta)$, but we have used the other prediction $\text{max}_{a'}\hat{q}(s',a',\bar{\theta})$ on each step.In reality the feedback loops are more complex that this, because this is function approximation so action value estimates from different $(s,a)$ pairs interact in ways that are hard to predict. But the worry is that bias causes divergence in estimates, and this does happen in practice. It is more likely to happen in environments with long episodes, or where state loops are possible.It is also worth noting that using the frozen target network has not solved the problem, it has just significantly throttled runaway feedback. The amount of throttling required to keep learning stable will vary depending on the problem. The number of steps between target network updates is a hyperparameter. Set it too low and you risk seeing stability problems. Set it too high and learning will take longer.I've tried implementing DQNs and DDPGs on Cartpole, and I've found that the algorithms fail to converge when target networks are used, but work fine when those target networks are removed.In that case, your implementations are incorrect. Definitely I have observed DQN with a target network working many times on Cartpole.Whether or not using a target network makes convergence faster or more stable is more complex, and it may be for your network design or hyperparameter choices that adding the target network is making performance worse."
Episodic Learning vs. Meta Learning in few-shot setting,"
As far as I understand, episodic learning involves training the model on episodes of tasks, where each task consists of a query set Q and support set S. On each episode the model is trained on the samples in S and then tested on query in Q. How does Meta-learning relate to this? Is episodic learning a precondition for meta-learning or can there be meta-learning without episodic learning or vice versa? All papers that I come across in few-shot learning (in the NER context) seem to use these terms somewhat interchangeably and I never found a real definition. I understand that Meta Learning is a ""learning to learn"" approach, where the model is updated based on each episode with the hope that it learns to generalize to unseen tasks better. But that must be the case in every episodic learning approach? otherwise it would not make sense to train on episodes.

When do you use epsilon in Reinforcement Learning?,"

Since it is an off-policy algorithm, we can collect data with any exploratory policy $\beta$ whilst learning about the greedy policy $\pi(s) = \arg\max_aQ(s,a)$. Typically $\beta$ will be an $\epsilon$-greedy, but you do not want to use this when updating your DQN. That is because you update your DQN using the Q-Learning update rule, by training it to approximate $r(s, a) + \gamma \max_a Q_{\bar{\theta}}(s', a)$, where $\bar{\theta}$ are the parameters of the target network."
Is there a chess engine whose architecture is composed purely of ranked/weighted constraints that then generate candidate moves for search?,"

","['natural-language-processing', 'data-preprocessing']","On a very basic level, you are absolutely correct about the encoding of the attached sentence. But, practically, when you have a set n number of documents to be encoded, things happen differently.Let's say we have n=1000 independent sentences.Now, doing it by hand is a little difficult, but let's say we have to do it. What you will start with is making a list of all the unique words there are and assigning each of them a number, let's call this our vocabulary. It might look like thisNow each possible word has a separate id assigned, you will go back to each of the sentences and encode them based on the number you assigned to each word in the last step. Note that in this method you need to be completely neutral about misspelled words assigning them different numbers as you find them. Of course, you can choose to correct the spelling if you wish, but you already are analyzing 1000 lines, why add one more task? Each line will now look something like what you mentioned in your question.You can use this encoded information in algorithms.But, to have better results, as mentioned you will need to correct the misspelled words, right? What if instead of n=1000 it was n=1,000,000 or like some trained models out there, with n=4 Billion documents, you can't possibly think to correct the spellings by hand (manually) right?So, researchers found more standardized methods. Essentially, we define a set of tokens, that might be a word like the, hell etc., or tokens (a sequence of letters) 1, a, b, c, blad, ght, etc. These tokens are designed based on multiple statistics the most important of which are length, and occurrence. Basically, if a word is too large it is taking space in the set, and if it is too rarely used, it can be broken into smaller tokens that might be a part of other words as well. The idea is to have tokens with similar frequency of occurrence when analyzed over a large corpus of data, but also include smaller tokens like a, b, etc. which can be used to account for new and previously unseen words. As you very correctly put it, computers understand numbers, and numbers can be anything as long as they make sense to computers.These sets contain a vocabulary of tokens that can be used to encode any word. Here are some examples to help consolidate my points-Revolution (correct spelling)
tokenized - ['rev', 'ol', 'u', 'tion']Revoluton (incorrect spelling)
tokenized - ['rev', 'ol', 'u', 't', 'on']Hi
tokenized - ['Hi']and so on.NOTE - The aforementioned tokens are only for illustration and might (probably will) differ from tokenizer to tokenizer.So, now instead of defining our own tokenizers which need to be designed with multiple aspects and considerations, you can choose to use a standardized one already designed and available online. Some examples would be, NLTK's tokenizer, Spacy's tokenizer, Gensim, WordPeice (used for BERT) for your case.Additionally, not having tokenizers has its own shortcomings, some of which are-If you add independent words to the vocabulary, then the vocabulary quickly gets out of hand (consider that the English language has around 1 million words, not to mention other languages if you plan on training a translator). Great tokenizers have achieved good results with a token vocabulary of as small as 30,000 tokens.As noted, the same words but wrong spellings hold space of their own and make the vocabulary unnecessarily longer. With standard tokens, you don't have to care about these misspelled words as they can be accounted for easily.Vocabulary based on words will fail in case of new words, and so every time new information comes up, you will have to add a new element to the vocabulary. As was with misspelled words, new words can be accounted for with standard token-based vocabularies as well.Hope this helps."

OpenAI confirm this approach in their general GPT documentation.Inherently, the core of ChatGPT - the GPT large language model - is not a chatbot.

About cosine noise schedule in Diffusion Model,"
Could you provide the explanation of Figure 4 from the paper at Improved Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models?
(1) The paper says, ""the end of the forward noising process is too noisy,and so doesn’t contribute very much to sample quality"". But if the goal is to have an image with only noise, why is it problematic to have a lot of noise?
(2) The paper says, ""a model trained with the linear schedule does not get much worse (as measured by FID) when we skip up to 20% of the reverse diffusion process"". But why is it the reverse diffusion process? Shouldn't the deterioration be related to the forward  process?
(3) Also, why is the training process relevant?
It seems to me that the explanation of this section means 'linear noise schedule is better than cosine one'.
Could you explain, please?

When do we apply a mask onto our padded values during attention mechanisms,"
When we are applying a mask onto the padded values in an input sequence, it is typically done through setting the padded values as negative infinity. For example, a tensor of values [1,2,3,0,0] should result in a padding mask of pad_mask = [True, True, True, False, False] (or the opposite depending on your flavour). However, if we apply the mask i.e attention_scores = attention_scores.masked_fill_(pad_mask.T == False, float('-inf')) before applying softmax, won't we get the 4th and 5th row of the attention_scores as 'nan' when we softmax attempts to calculate the probability distribution along each row?
Does that mean the step of where to apply the mask is incorrect, and we should apply a zero-ing out of the pad token rows in the attention_score matrix after applying the softmax function? or is there another key concept/step I am missing here

Datasets for conversation topic classification with focus on chat,"
Are there good datasets or even pretrained models for classifying chat lines? I'd like to infer the topic people are talking about and possibly topic changes.
One of the problems with data that is available for training is very specific bias. There are, for example, large sets of chatlogs of tech support channels, but they have only a few topics and all of them are technical. In general seems it hard to find on which data to train a network that generalizes for different kind of channels with a more or sometimes less fixed topic without training on that.
If you look into non-technical topics of chat rooms you have other focuses, flirt chats are common, but there are also chat rooms which focus for example on the related forum for aquarium owners. Now the aquarium owners probably talk about the very basic topic like weather and, of course, aquariums.
Also data sets like Tweets are probably a bad approximation as most Tweets are self-contained and many chat lines only make sense in the context of a few lines before.

Failing to train and avoid overfit on noisy training data,"
I have added some Gaussian noise to CIFAR10 training and test set. I am using VGG16 and ResNet34 as the model to be used for training. 
Under normal training conditions, where the standard CIFAR10 is used(without any Gaussian noise), the training happens as expected. The model does not overfit when trained using the right transforms and data augmentation. I am able to achieve 95% training accuracy and 91% test accuracy.
But if I add minor Gaussian noise to the entire training and test set and train the model using the same transforms, the model overfits considerably. The training accuracy reached 98% whereas the test accuracy does not go past 80%.
My initial reasoning for this was that I used color jittering for the transforms during normal training(when using clean data). But since color jittering is similar to gaussian noise, it does not prove to be an effective image augmentation technique when the model is being trained on data with gaussian noise.
I added salt and pepper noise as additional augmentation techniques when trying to train on the noise data, but it does not have any effect and continues to overfit.
For the hyperparameters: 
I am using the Adam Optimizer, tried SGD as well. 
I tried various learning rates 0.1, 0.01, 0.02, 0.025, 0.005, 0.001 along with step schedulers to reduce the learning rate. 
I experimented with weight decays from 1e-04 to 1e-06. 
The transforms I used for clean data training are:
transforms = transforms.Compose(
[transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(), 
transforms.RandomRotation(15), 
transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=15, shear=15, scale=(0.85,1.15)), transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.15, contrast=0.15, saturation=0.15, hue=0.15), transforms.ToTensor(), 
transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) 
])

The transforms I tried when trying to train the models from scratch on the gaussian noise data are:
transforms = transforms.Compose(
[transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(), 
transforms.RandomRotation(15), 
transforms.RandomAffine(degrees=15, shear=15, scale=(0.85,1.15)), transforms.ColorJitter(brightness=0.15, contrast=0.15, saturation=0.15, hue=0.15), 
SaltPepperNoiseTransform(prob=0.1, amount=0.05), 
SpeckleNoiseTransform(std=0.15),
transforms.ToTensor(), 
transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)) 
])

I experimented with different values for each augmentation I applied.
How can I achieve the same training and test accuracy when training the model from scratch on the Gaussian noise training and Gaussian noise test data as I did on training from scratch on clean CIFAR 10 training and test data ?

Why is ChatGPT fast on some questions and slow on others?,"
When using ChatGPT i have noticed it is fast on some questions and slow on others. Why is that?
Based on my understanding of the transformers architecture, the user prompt is tokenized and the vector of token ids is fed as input to a strictly feed-forward neural network and the output of the model becomes part of the input for the next token that the model has to generate (this gives the model its auto-regressive nature).
Since there are no conditional loops in the NN, I would expect the time to generate the first token should depend on the length of user prompt. It shouldn't matter whether the question being asked is easy or tough. But I have clearly observed that when asked an easy question ChatGPT responds very fast and when asked a tough question it takes time to respond. Why is that? Is it due to caching of previous responses?

This is a Transformer Decoder model in which one branch of the Decoder predicts the HTML structure sequence for a table image and the other predicts the bbox for corresponding cell tokens ('< td >', '< td >< /td >', '<td').

In this, DIoU gives a value of 1.0 for boxes which are [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0]. So, I subtract the number of masked boxes from the total loss to keep it consistent however, the model is predicting random boxes in places where it should predict properly. I'm not sure if this approach is correct in terms of weights/gradient updates. Is there any other way to use DIoU/CIoU with masks?
CIoU straight away gives nan for [0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0] because it considers the aspect ratio also, so I couldn't figure out how to fix that.

The ultimate task is: given a stream of x/y/z and timestamps can we classify a subset of the stream as one of the movement types in the training data?

I'm specifically looking for guidance on how to start thinking about this problem. Is this a time series classification problem? Any suggestions on how to encode the data or features to extract? I'm sure there is some precedent but I am having trouble finding a starting place. Thank you in advance.

I have a seemingly innocent question. I was looking to buy a computer for deep learning development using large language models. When I searched online on consumer e-commerce websites, I could not find any computer with NVIDIA P100, V100 for sale. Why? These are the GPUs used for deep learning on cloud VMs. Consumer GPUs (I use this term to mean GPUs available in computers you will find on sale on e-commerce websites such as Amazon.com) on the other hand seem to be centered around so-called RTX series built for gaming applications. I tried looking for GPU benchmarks on 3 different sites [1,2,3] and cannot find any mention of P100, V100 etc. All of them are filled with RTX.
What is the difference between these chipsets? And more specifically, is there some inherent difference that will make RTX GPUs suboptimal if I were to use one for ML tasks (as opposed to gaming)?

LUT-Based Sigmoid and Tanh Activation-Functions in Integer Quantized Networks,"
I want to understand how activation functions, specifically tanh and sigmoid, are used in int8 quantized neural networks. Even more specific, I want to understand a Look-up-Table based approach.
My problem is that the relation of data width and size of the LUT, scaling factor and zero point will affect which index of the LUT I have to use for the calculation. E.g. TFLite-Micro has an implementation of such a LUT for tanh and sigmoid. They have an implementation, but I do not understand how they calculate the indices. Is there some guidance on how to design such a function available somewhere? I haven't managed to find anything more specific.
","['deep-learning', 'long-short-term-memory', 'activation-functions', 'hardware']","Their lookup-table is declared as uint16_t sigmoid_table_uint16[256]. At the bottom is a plot.Their Tanh() function gets 16bit inputs. Those are presumably the accumulated (and biased) results of several 8bit multiplications. So at this point there is no zero-point to consider any more, only a scaling factor.(My understanding is that zero-point this is only relevant during the 8bit matrix-multiplication, but I'm not 100% sure to be honest. The results of the 8bit multiplications are of course 16bit, and you don't go back to 8bit until you have to.)According to the code, the scaling is $\frac{\text{input_multiplier}}{2^{\text{input_left_shift}}}$. But the point is really to scale the input such that $2^{8+8}$ corresponds to a floating-point input of 10.7 (the chosen end of the table). We are in 32bit integer-land by now, and the input can be larger than $2^{8+8}$.The number $2^{8+8}$ contains two engineering choices. First, the size of the look-up table. They have chosen 256 entries, so the top 8 bits will be the index. Second, the precision for linear interpolation (fraction part of the index). They have chosen 8 bits. An alternative would be zero, simply returning the nearest value from the table.Now they divide by $2^8$ (the expression abs_input_data >> 8) to get the index, and use the remainder of the division (abs_input_data & 0xFF) for linear interpolation between the actual and the next value from the look-up table.Here they interpolate between ua and ub, which are adjacent 16bit values from the table, using ut (the 8-bit remainder).To get a float sigmoid result (between 0.5 and 1.0) you'd have to divide by $2^{16+8}$.If you check the plot below, the table has the right half of a 16bit unsigned sigmoid. But they want tanh. So they add back the sign and subtract the zero-point. The zero-point is at $2^{16+8-1}$ and written as 1<<(14 + 9) in their the code.We still have to divide by $2^8$ from the interpolation, and shift one bit right to make room for the sign that we added, but we also have to divide by two to go from sigmoid to tanh. Those cancel out, and we divide by $2^8$ with rounding.Rounding is done by adding 128 (or 1 << (9 - 2) in the code). But you also have to be concerned about the asymmetric range of signed integers, and whether C is rounding towards zero or towards negative infinity. Which is probably why they saturate at 0xFFFF00 instead of 0xFFFFFF but I'm not certain. With that, we're knee-deep in the engineering swamp and I've probably lost all the machine learning people, so I'll leave it at that.TL;DR: Fixed-point math is not too hard to grasp, just impossible to read and validate. That's the price you pay to avoid costly conversions to/from floats."

Difference between using transformer for multi-class classification and clustering using last hidden layer,"

I am confused on what is the difference between ""fine tuning a transformer model for multi-class classification and use it with a classification header for multi-class classification on new data"" and ""fine tuning a transformer model for multi-class classification and then extract the last hidden layer embeddings and perform clustering on them"".
At the moment I am fine-tuning the model with 6 classes. Then pass through the new data on the trained model and extract the last hidden layer embeddings and cluster them.
The elbow for clustering always show 6 clusters.
Is that because there is actually only 6 categories, or am I interfering the clustering process by using a fine-tuned model for 6 classes?

In which community does using a Bayesian regression model as a reward function with exploration vs. exploitation challenges fall under?,"
I am trying to find research papers addressing a problem that, in my opinion, deserves significant attention. However, I am having difficulty locating relevant information.
To illustrate the problem at hand, consider a multivariate Bayesian regression model represented as $y_t = b_1 \cdot x_{1,t}^{c_1} + b_2 \cdot x_{2,t}^{c_2}$. The purpose of this model is to estimate rewards $y_t$ based on inputs ($x_{1,t}$, $x_{2,t}$) at each time step denoted by $t$. The parameters $b_1$ and $b_2$ are assumed to follow a half-normal distribution, while $c_1$ and $c_2$ follow a gamma distribution. I aim to plan inputs over a given horizon $H$ given a specified budget $\left(\sum_t x_{1,t} + \sum_{t} x_{2,t} \le \mbox{budget}\right)$, with the main objective of maximizing cumulative rewards. To help with this goal, it is important to also gain knowledge about the model parameters to facilitate improved allocation of inputs for maximizing cumulative rewards in the future.
Every day we make a decision on how to allocate a portion of the total budget and every day we receive a response ($y=\mbox{sales}$). Typically, we have access to 30-300 daily data points to establish the initial posterior, and the planning horizon is typically 30 days.
This problem exhibits a trade-off between exploration and exploitation, which is commonly encountered in communities such as reinforcement learning and dual control. However, the constraint of only being able to run experiments based on the exact functional form of the model, rather than simulations in the real environment, makes it challenging to apply standard reinforcement learning techniques. While elements of this problem can be found in other communities, such as Bayesian experimental design and active learning, these approaches primarily address the exploration aspect.
An intuitive strategy could involve incorporating certain aspects of active learning, such as maximum information gain, along with an $\epsilon$-greedy approach. In this strategy, the mean of the posterior predictive distribution of the input can be used during exploitation, while maximum information gain can guide exploration by proposing new inputs. I can of course think of more approaches, Thompson sampling being one of them where we sample a single sample of parameters from our posterior and use it as ground truth in the downstream optimization task. Another one is to take multiple samples and use the mean of the posterior predictive distribution. One could be UCB with some tweaks etc. A third one could be to take a Thompson sample and compute the downstream optimization task and repeat it iteratively to get an comprehension of the variance of possible solutions and maybe in the end take the mean or median.

Despite the belief that this problem falls within the realm of sequential decision optimization and should have received extensive research attention, it is challenging to find specific resources that tackle this type of problem.
Question: In which communities can I find more information about my problem type?

After reading the reports provided in the response below and examining various model-based Bayesian reinforcement learning techniques, several concerns arose in my mind, accompanied by potential solution strategies. To address these concerns and demonstrate some techniques applicable to resolving this matter, I initiated a new discussion thread.

Methods for sequential decision optimization problem with nonlinear bayesian reward function In this current question, I am solely interested in hearing about which communities have been trying to attack this problem type.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'exploration-exploitation-tradeoff', 'bayesian-optimization', 'optimal-policy']","One community that has very recently been attacking problems of the type posed by your question is the Bayesian sequential optimal experimental design (Bayesian sOED) community. The Bayesian sOED setting generally assumes that there is a current belief state $x_k \in \mathcal{X}$ over an underlying system with some unknown quantity (in your case, unknown parameters) and possible design choices $d_k \in \mathcal{D}$ that may be conditioned on the current belief state. Performing experiment $k \in \{0, 1, 2, \ldots, N-1\}$ is equivalent to choosing a design $d_k$, receiving an observation $y_k \in \mathcal{Y}$ from the underlying system, and earning a utility $g(x_k, d_k, y_k) \in \mathbb{R}$ based on the current belief state $x_k$, design choice $d_k$, and observation $y_k$. The goal is to choose a sequence of designs $(d_0, d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_{N-1})$ that maximizes the expected sum of utility across all experiments. Learning more information about the underlying system (e.g. the unknown parameters) is directly helpful in achieving that goal by producing more informative belief states $x_{k+1}$ after the conclusion of each experiment.The above experimental design setting is:Since your exact question is simply asking about relevant research communities, I won't make any specific remarks in this answer regarding how to solve your illustrative problem using Bayesian sOED (feel free to make a follow-up question on that topic, if desired). Instead, I will list some references that I personally have found useful for solving problems in this field, with those most directly related to the Bayesian sOED problem listed first:"
Choosing the most appropriate neural network type,"
I want to use deep learning to improve cache hit rate. Let me explain a few basic principles of the cache.
Each cache entry can have one of two different priorities. The priorities decide when that cache line is evicted(lower priority first). In general, a cache should aim to have a hit rate as high as possible.
Currently the priorities are assigned statically according to the traffic type. And all entries belonging to the same traffic type would have the same priority.
Based on experiments I have conducted, this is not the best algorithm for highest hit rate. Cache hit rate improves if the prioroties are set based on the access pattern.
For example, suppose address 100 belonging to traffic type A is accessed for a certain period of time, and then other addresses belonging to traffic type A are accessed, and 100 is accessed again. Due to the intervening accesses to other addresses between the 2 two periods of accesses to 100, the entry corresponding to 100 gets evicted and needs to be refetched again. However, if 100 was assigned a higher priority, it would not be evicted and cache hit rate would be higher.
This is a naive example just to give an idea of what the problem statement is. The actual traffic pattern is very complex and it is generally very hard to manually pick which addresses to give a high priority. I hope to achieve this with a deep learning network.
For the moment, we can assume that the access pattern is known before hand. The goal is to initially feed the access pattern to the deep learning network. And then when the accesses are actually made, the network assigns the most appropriate priorities to the incoming requests and this should improve the cache hit rate.
What kind of of a neural network best suites this requirement? For training the network, I don't have any cues except the cache hit rate - a hit rate higher than baseline indicates that the network is performing well.
I don't have much experience in neural networks. Any leads related to the class of neural networks that can solve such a problem and details related to how it will be trained are much appreciated.

How to learn Categorial Embeddings in Unsupervised Learning?,"
I want to cluster mixed-type tabular data, for the categorial columns I want to use Categorial Embeddings and then an Autoencoder Network before clustering with KMeans or similar.
Now, when I want to train my model, the Batch will be fed into the Embeddings Layers and then the Autoencoder, which will then reconstruct the Embeddings. My Question is, what value should be passed into the loss function? Since the Decoder reconstructs the embedded columns, I cant pass the original categorial values.
Solutions I found here and here propose to save the Input Batch as a in a variable after feeding it into the Embeddings Layer (but before the AE) and use that as the target for the loss function.
I am a ML/DL beginner, but this sounds fishy to me, because the Embeddings will not be trained by gradient descent. I tested this approach on a small tabular dataset vs. just feeding the categorial data into the AE (no Embeddings) and found that using the first approach (saving embedded cols as variable) to moderatly degrade Clustering Accuracy and NMI Score (This is not representative - just a small test on a small dataset).

I need to make a sentence generator for a limited set of vocabulary (about 600 words). The requirements are:

It must use only the words that are on the list, and never go beyond that;
It must produce sentences of varying syntactic structures, including complex sentences, relative clauses, tenses etc (not just the basic ""SVO"" sentences or whatever);
The sentences must be at reasonably meaningful and make sense at least most of the time (meaning that the sentences like ""Colourless green ideas sleep furiously"" shouldn't be generated).

I'd like to ask what's the best way to go about it.
The ""varying sentence structures"" part is the easy one: I can do the grammar.
The issue, however, is the ""meaningfullness"" part. So far, I reckon that in order to implement it, I would need to generate a collocations database for each word: other words can it govern, and as what arguments specifically (e.g., the verb ""give"" can govern animate nouns as agents and recipients, and inanimate nouns as patients; while the verb can generally only govern some speech-related nouns like ""story"", ""words"" or ""truth"" as patients). I should probably be able to extract this information from a corpus: I would need to use something like deeppavlov to parse the sentence structures (in order to extract the exact relationship between words), and some tool to account for irregular verbs and inflections (I would want for all forms of the same word to be treated as the same word, obviously).
However, collocations alone aren't enough to ensure meaningful sentences: even if every clause consists of only meaningful collocations, it still doesn't prevent, say, unrelated clauses to co-occur in the same complex sentence (""I have to go to school because my dog is brown"", or whatever). So in addition to a collocations database, I think I would also need a co-occurrence database, essentially telling how likely is each of the 600 words to co-occur with each of the other 599 words in the same sentence, regardless of their syntactic relationship. Basically, a total of 360000 probability values.
I'd like to ask for advice. Am I missing anything, is there perhaps an easier way to go about what I want to do?
Also, are there perhaps any existing solutions for my requirements? I briefly tried tweaking with the ChatGPT for a while, but getting it to stick to the list of words and at the same time produce diverse sentences had driven me insane pretty quickly.
P.S. So far, I'm kinda leaning towards a non-neural-network solution because of the small vocabulary list.
I'll appreciate any help or advice.
","['natural-language-processing', 'natural-language-generation']","Building a sentence generator with a limited vocabulary looks like a challenging task, but I think it's definitely feasible. At least, while there may not be an out-of-the-box solution tailored to your exact requirements, you can leverage existing libraries and tools to simplify the development process. For instance, those like NLTK, SpaCy, or Stanford CoreNLP (which I've never used) provide various linguistic resources, including POS taggers, parsers, and syntactic information, which can help you build the necessary components. Anyway, this is what I would do:Vocabulary and Sentence Structures:
You already mentioned that generating varying sentence structures is relatively straightforward, so we won't focus on that.Collocations Database:
Creating a collocations database for each word is a good idea. This database should capture the possible arguments and dependencies for each word in your limited vocabulary. Extracting this information from a corpus, as you suggested, can be achieved using tools like Part-of-Speech (POS) taggers and dependency parsers. These tools can help identify the relationships between words in sentences and extract the required information. You can use libraries such as NLTK or SpaCy for this purpose.Co-occurrence Database:
To address the issue of unrelated clauses co-occurring, you can create a co-occurrence database. This database should store the likelihood of each word in your limited vocabulary co-occurring with every other word. You can calculate these probabilities from a large corpus by counting the occurrences of word pairs in the same sentence or context. The values in the database will represent the probabilities of co-occurrence.Here's a high-level architecture diagram for your sentence generator:In my diagram above, 1. the collocations database stores information about the possible arguments and dependencies for each word in your limited vocabulary. After, 2. the co-occurrence database stores the probabilities of each word co-occurring with every other word. Then, 3. the sentence generator utilizes the collocations and co-occurrence information to generate sentences. Finally, 4. the syntactic rules component incorporates the syntactic structures and grammar rules to ensure proper sentence formation.
To generate a sentence:In details, 1) you choose a starting word from your limited vocabulary. After, 2) Use the collocations database to select the next word based on the possible arguments and dependencies. Then, 3) you utilize the co-occurrence database to determine the probability of co-occurrence between the current word and potential next words. Last, 4) you select the next word based on the highest probability from the co-occurrence database.
Repeat steps 2-4 until you reach the desired sentence length or a suitable stopping condition."
How are groups created in maxout units when dividing the set of inputs 𝑧 into groups of 𝑘 values?,"
I don't get $G^(i)$the set of indices into the inputs for group $i$, $\{(i −1)k+ 1, . . . , ik\}$ when creating a maxout units/function, these thing that outputs the maximum element of groups: $$g(z)_i= max_{[j∈G^{(i)}]}z_j$$

Maxout units(Goodfellow et al., 2013a) generalize rectiﬁed linear
units. Instead of applying an element-wise function $g(z)$,
maxout units divide $z$ into groups of $k$ values. Each maxout unit
then outputs the maximum element of one of these groups:
$$g(z)_i= max_{[j∈G^{(i)}]}z_j$$
where $G^{(i)}$is the set of indices into the inputs for group
$i$,$\{(i −1)k+ 1, . . . , ik\}$.
This provides a way of learning a piecewise linear function that
responds to multiple directions in the input $x$ space. A maxout unit
can learn a piecewise linear, convex function with up to $k$ pieces.
Maxout units can thus be seen as learning the activation function
itself rather than just the relationship between units. With large
enough $k$, a maxout unit can learn to approximate any convex function
with arbitrary ﬁdelity. In particular, a maxout layer with two pieces
can learn to implement the same function of the input $x$ as a
traditional layer using the rectiﬁed linear activation function, the
absolute value rectiﬁcation function, or the leaky or parametric ReLU,
or it can learn to implement a totally diﬀerent function altogether.
The maxout layer will, of course, be parametrized diﬀerently from any
of these other layer types, so the learning dynamics will be diﬀerent
even in the cases where maxout learns to implement the same function
of $x$ as one of the other layer types.
Deep Learning, Bengio and al. page 190

I tried to work it out with a concrete example:
Let's take a concrete example with k = 3. In this case, the groups would be as follows:
$$G^{(1)} = {(1 - 1)3 + 1, ..., 1 * 3} = \{1, 2, 3\}$$
$$G^{(2)} = {(2 - 1)3 + 1, ..., 2 * 3} = \{4, 5, 6\}$$
$$G^{(3)} = {(3 - 1)3 + 1, ..., 3 * 3} = \{7, 8, 9\}$$
And so on...
So, in this example, if we have 9 inputs, we'd have 3 maxout units, and each maxout unit would use 3 inputs to calculate its output, choosing the maximum from these 3 values.
Suppose we want to model the cost of producing a certain number of units of military weapons as a function of the quantity produced. We can use a piecewise linear function for this.
So let's imagine that the production cost is defined by a convex function with three pieces (k = 3):

For the first 100 units produced, the cost is \$10,000 per unit.
For 101 to 200 units, the cost is \$8,000 per unit.
For 201 units and above, the cost is \$7,000 per unit.

So here, I guess each maxout unit would take as input the quantity produced, and each group $G^(i)$ would be associated with one of the pieces of the function.
For example, if we wanted to calculate the cost of production for 150 units, I'm not sure but I guess we'd have :
$G^{(1)} = \{1, 2, 3\}$ corresponding to the first part of the function (\$10,000 per unit).
$G^{(2)} = \{4, 5, 6\}$ corresponding to the second part of the function (\$8,000 per unit).
I don't get what are $\{1, 2, 3\}$ and $\{4, 5, 6\}$ standing for, concretely
If I apply the maxout function for each group, I guess it means that maxout unit 1 will select the maximum of the values associated with $G^{(1)}$, and maxout unit 2 will select the maximum of the values associated with $G^{(2)}$, and so on ... but then it doesn't make any sens
Indeed, for 150 units, I guess maxout 1 would give a value of \$10,000 per unit, and maxout 2 would give a value of \$10,000 per unit, ... I don't know how I am expected to calculate the total cost of production then ...
I am a slow but passionate learner in math and deep learning. Don't hesitate to explain it to me as if I was a teenager.

MCTS: Units away from the action,"
I'm trying to implement Monte Carlo Tree Search for (a simplified version of) the boardgame Commands and Colors -- I'm setting up a scenario where the AI side has overwhelming force: 6 units vs 3 units played by the human.
I would hope that MCTS moves the 6 units in for the kill; instead what happens is that some units attack, some move sideways, and some retreat.
I suspect that the units in the front are already strong enough to make victory likely, so that the unit in the back does not see a difference in its moving closer to the action, and chooses to move away from it.  I suspect that when evaluating the value of the moves of the far away unit, the ""noise"" caused by the action of the units in the front, whose actions make the value of the position swing heavily, make it very difficult to evaluate the smaller contribution to the quality of the position made by moving the unit in the back.
This is sad!  A human player would move all units towards the enemy, bc if the front units get damaged, they will be moved away from the front and replaced by second-line units.  Having units move randomly away from the action makes no sense.
How do I fix it?

Why use masked attention in the second to 6th decoder blocks during training,"
For the first block we have access to all the output tokens, so we will have to use masked self-attention. After that in the first decoder block, we have encoder-decoder attention, which will bring some information about the future tokens, but this information is not cheating because model is only seeing future tokens in input language (let's say the transformer is translating from one to another language). So the final output of the first decoder block might have some features from the future token but they will be from the input language and this can help the model decode the current word better. So is there a reason to mask from second to 6th decoder block that I am missing?

2D layout problem with RL - questions about state representation,"
I want to solve the following sort of problem with RL, specifically Q-learning (using the tensorflow-agents library):
The input is a polygon $\mathcal{P}$ and a list of rectangle sizes $\mathcal{L}=\{s_{1}=[h_1,w_1],s_2=[h_2,w_2],\ldots,s_k=[h_k,w_k]\}$. It is required to place polygons of the sizes given in $\mathcal{L}$ inside $\mathcal{P}$ without overlap. Each configuration is scored at the end of the episode according to the placed rectangles' total area and some other criteria which are immaterial at the moment.
My problem is how to represent the problem in a way that allows for generalization. My first approach was to discretize the polygon $\mathcal{P}$ and to define an action = (rectangle placement) as a triple $(x_{TL}, y_{TL}, i \in \{1,\ldots,k\})$ and to train a DQN agent. But this approach forces me to train a separate agent for each instance $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{L})$ which is woefully inefficient and very unsatisfying.
So what I am looking for is a way to somehow:
(1) encode the state/observation in a fixed-length representation
(2) encode the action space in a fixed-lenght representation
while
(3) taking into account the fact that part of the action is choosing a placement point in $\mathcal{P}$
I thought about handling (1) by training an autoencoder that takes as input a, say, $299x299$ image of $\mathcal{P}$ with a number of polygons drawn inside it and learns an internal code of length, say, $100$. But I fail to see how to handle (2) and (3) with this approach.
Any suggestions or pointers will be greatly appreciated.

How to train Diffusion model with additional loss?,"
I would like to train a diffusion model with an additional loss on the created image. Without getting into too much details my intention is to do something like regularization, for example you may think that I want to make sure the created image is smooth, or something of the sort.
My thinking was to add an additional loss during training, if the vanilla training process is:
$$L = ||\epsilon-\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)||$$
where $\epsilon_\theta$ is the model learning to predict the noise $\epsilon$ added to the original image. My suggested loss is:
$$L = ||\epsilon-\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)|| + \lambda * L'(img_\theta)$$
where $L'$ is my additional loss (which may for example induce smoothness or whatever), $img_\theta$ is the image that we get after denoising $x_t$ using the predicted noise.
For standart models it is trivial that this makes sense. Due to the iterative nature of diffusion models I'm not sure if specifically for them it makes sense. I wasn't able to find any work that does something like this, would appreciate any help, does my additional loss makes sense to add?

Relation between the number of parameters and the features in Gradient descent algorithm,"

My book describes this as an equation for minimizing the $\theta$ value, but I have a few questions regarding the intuition behind this equation:

The book describes $j$ as the number of features. If we have to compute the $\theta$ value for every $j$, does this mean that the number of features $\left(x_1,\:x_2,...\right)$ is equal to the number of parameters $\left(\theta _1,\:\theta _2,...\right)$?

How are the initial $\theta$ and $\alpha$ values selected? What if the initial values selected are too low/ too high?

DDQN doesn't learn my modified version of Taxi-v3 from OpenAI,"

Don't worry, I'm not starting with multi-agent RL for debugging, I decided for a simple 3x3 grid with one passenger, one taxi, and no borders.
Here is some random starting state:

|A: : | 
|a:0: | 
| : : |
+-----+

a is the current location of a passenger, A its destination location, and 0 the location of the taxi. The taxi will get a positive reward when first picking up the passenger and then dropping him/her off at A; everything else is punished.
After spending quite some time debugging it, I decided to ask for help ... my DDQN agent does not learn!

Looked at weights and biases (the network seems to learn something)
Used logging (didn't see anything out of the ordinary)
Tracked various metrics like the reward.

But even after 5000 epochs of training, the DRL agent selects the same action all the time. The action selected might vary with different start states, but it doesn't vary in one epoch.

What is the main difference between class label prediction through Machine Learning and Conditional Label generation that can be done on raw data?,"

Am I missing something? Or am I misunderstanding something?
Please clarify if you can.
","['convolutional-neural-networks', 'convolution']","By reading the paper that proposed the idea of (2+1)Convolutions, it seems that the Conv2Plus1D implementation of the tutorial is partially incorrect.By citing the paper (section 3.5):[...] full 3D convolutions may be more conveniently approximated by a 2D convolution followed by a 1D convolution, decomposing spatial and temporal modeling into two separate steps.So they assume a 3D conv, with an $N\times t\times d\times d$ kernel (where $t$ is the timesteps, and $d$ the depth), can be ""factorized"" into space and time components by two convolutions: one is $N\times 1\times d \times d$ with $M$ filters, and the other has a $M\times t\times \times 1$ kernel with $N$ filters. The former is the spatial convolution, and the latter is the temporal one.Now:The hyperparameter $M$ determines the dimensionality of the intermediate subspace.They provide a formula to compute $M$:
$$M_i = \frac{td^2 N_{i-1}N_i}{d^2 N_{i-1} + tN_i},$$
where $i$ is the layer index. Basically, with such a formula they choose $M$ so that:[...] the number of parameters in the (2+1)D block is approximately equal to that implementing full 3D convolution.In short, the first conv in Conv2Plus1D should have $M_i$ filters, and the second conv $N_i$ filters (i.e., the number you would use for the regular 3D conv.). Indeed, can be that $M_i = N_i$ as in the tutorial but that won't follow the paper. Now, if you compute $M_i$ according to the eq. you'll get approximately the same overall number of parameters compared to a full 3D conv. But you can set it as you wish, thus also reducing the #parameters if you want to do so."
Do all CNNs learn to detect edges in the first layer?,"
I was looking at 3D CNNs that process volumetric data, e.g. for MRI images of brain, where the input is a 4D tensor, and I couldn't find images from the filters of the first layer.
Suppose that detecting a spherical shape is very important for the underlying task (e.g. classifying if a person has a tumor cancer or not). In that case, isn't detecting planes than edges more relevant? So, should the learned filters look like planes in 3D?
Moreover, if is it true that all CNNs learn to detect edges in the first layer, does this mean the kernel size dictates the number of filters we should use? For example, if our input is a grayscale image of dimensions $25 \times 25$ (we use a 2D CNN) and we use a kernel size of $3 \times 3$, is it meaningful to use more than $3$ filters? I mean the only edges that can be detected are those at angles: $0$ (vertical edge), $90$ (horizontal edge) and $45, -45$ (diagonal edges).

"In the original diffusion model paper, why do they sample the first step with the same loss?","
In the original diffusion model paper by Sohl-Dickstein et al., they explain very little about calculating the loss and training and network to learn the diffusion process. They did publish a repository with code here, which gives a few more clues.
Now there is one thing I don't particularly understand, and that is that although the KL divergence is taken over $t=2..T$,

in the code, they sample $t=1..T-1$ and say in the comments,
# choose a timestep in [1, self.trajectory_length-1].
# note the reverse process is fixed for the very
# first timestep, so we skip it.

Now if I understand correctly, with the first timestep of the reverse process is just $t=T$, which is just the isotropic gaussian, but what I don't understand is, why do they sample from $t=1$ instead of $t=2$ like in the KL divergence.
Also, if you were indeed to sample from $t=2$, how do you learn $f_{\mu}(x^1,1),f_{\Sigma}(x^1,1)$ so that you can reverse the last step? I would expect that to come form the entropy $H_q(X^{(1)}|X^{(0)})$, but from the code we see that they replace that with the entropy of a Gaussian with $\sigma=\sqrt{1 - a_1} = \sqrt{b_1}$,
$$
H_q(X^{(1)}|X^{(0)}) = \frac{1}{2}(\log 2 \pi + 1) + \frac{1}{2}\log b_1
$$
In the reverse process, you also see that they don't handle the last step of the reverse process any differently.
Summarising, how can they sample $t \in 1..T-1$, and calculate the KL divergence, while the equation specifies that $t \in 2..T$?
EDIT: After analysing the code further, it looks like they are not learning the last denoising step, and are only generating $x^{(1)}$.

Can I combined the trained model between different source but same model structure?,"
Here I got two different deep-learning models that were trained by LSTM and time-series data.
The data is the usage percentage of CPU from two different computers.
Each computer job was the same. It was a simple stress test with different stress power and period.
Basically, the target source is the same as CPU. but data is not the same.
Based on two time-series data, I trained the model using LSTM and finally, I got two '*h5' saved models.
As a step of data preprocessing, I applied 'Differencing' which is the removing step in order to erase trends and periodical conditions. And also the scaling by 0 to 1.
Due to the 'Differencing', the model can train the data's potential variation.
And the model will use a future stress test reference and will provide some safety guidelines.
I think the data characteristics are basically the same because it is CPU.
My question is, Can I combine two trained models and believe in the performance?
I didn't validate and test this issue but MY current opinion is,

Because of Differencing, Each model might train the CPU's potential variation. So It is already independent of the trend or periodical behavior. Both data can use for the single model.
Basically, Each data represented the CPU conditions. Even if one data had a dramatic variation, It can be treated as a special case from long CPU data. big data is always better than small data. so Both data can use for this.

"Why is $p(x)=\int p(x,z) dz$ intractable for continuous $z$ in VAE?","
In VAE we use the importance sampling trick to use $q_\phi(z|x)$ to help maximize $\log p_\theta(x)=\log \int p_\theta(x,z)dz\ge \int q_\phi(z|x)\log \frac{p_\theta(x,z)}{q_\phi(z|x)} dz$. Meanwhile, when we're dealing with something like $\int q_\phi(z|x) f(\cdot) dz$, we can change the integral into an expectation $E_{z\sim q_\phi(z|x) }f(\cdot)$ and evaluate it by sampling some (or one) $z$ in the training process.
So the problem is, why can't we do the same thing with $p_\theta(x)$ by writing it as $\int p_\theta(x,z)dz=\int p(z)p_\theta(x|z) dz=E_{z\sim p(z)}p_\theta(x|z)$ and sample some $z$ from the std normal distribution?
Or from another perspective, optimal $q_\phi(z|x)$ should be $p_\theta(z|x)$. Then $p_\theta(x)= \int q_\phi(z|x)\frac{p_\theta(x,z)}{q_\phi(z|x)} dz=\int p_\theta(z|x)\frac{p_\theta(x,z)}{p_\theta(z|x)} dz=\int p_\theta(z|x)p_\theta(x) dz$. Then why do we have to split $ p_\theta(x,z)$ into $p_\theta(z|x)p_\theta(x)$ instead of $p(z)p_\theta(x|z)$?
I know sampling using $E_{z\sim p(z)}p_\theta(x|z)$ makes no sense because $z$ doesn't help with the training at all and $p_\theta(x|z)$ will have to fit all $x$ for all $z$. But this seems mathematically equivalent, so I have no idea why sampling $z$ is not possible, while sampling $q_\phi(z|x)$ is the standard for evaluating the integral.

After training the neural network on PyTorch, I find that the output is not permuted according to the graph structure. I would assume that for the input
x=torch.tensor([1,2,3,4])
if I get the following output:
tensor([20.7212, 20.7212, 20.5522, 20.2472])
for
x=torch.tensor([2,1,3,4])
I should get:
tensor([20.7212, 20.7212, 20.2472, 20.5522])
But this is the output I actually get:
tensor([20.7212, 20.7212, 20.5715, 20.2280])
I do not understand this behavior, or whether I'm missing something or making a mistake. Any help will be appreciated.

ChatGPT4all to create chatbot to answer questions on your own docs without external calls,"
So, I came across this Tutorial (Apologies, if you cannot access it, it is a member's only story) and I gave it a shot. Technically, it ""works"". However, it seems to be a bit poor in the sense that I only fed it 5-600 PDF files and even if I ask a question copying the title of the file, it gives some other answers. I played around with the ""template"" variable and this seems to be the best to me. Basically, I just want it to answer questions from the ""context"" which is basically an index of my docs. Any suggestions on how to improve this?

One very irritating thing about this is also that it prints the whole ""template"" variable, I cannot seem to get rid of it, because I must use the ""context"", and even if it gets the right context 95% of the time, it still gives a wrong answer, not sure why?
EDIT:- I see that there are LLMs you can download and feed your docs and they start answering questions about your docs right away. So, I think  steering the GPT4All to my index for the answer consistently is probably something I do not understand. It should not need fine-tuning or any training as neither do other LLMs. So, my guess is that I am lacking in the ""template"" area? maybe and perhaps tempereture, top_p etc. :(

What are the differences between RVC and SO-VITS-SVC models?,"
I'm trying to decide which one to use for my project but I can't find anywhere specific differences or comparisons of the models.
",['audio-processing'],"From what I've seen, these two models have similar architectures since they took the architecture of SoftVC and combine it with the design of VITS. The RVC is a succession of SoVITS and it has some improvements.Firstly, the RVC used ContentVec as the content encoder rather than HuBERT. ContentVec is an improved version of HuBERT, and it can ignore speaker information and only focus on content.Secondly, the RVC used top1 retrieval to reduce tone leakage. It is just like the codebook used in VQ-VAE, mapping the unseen input into known input in the training dataset.But according to the 4.1 version update in the SoVITS repo, they replaced HuBERT with ContentVec and also added feature retrieval functionality, so their performance should be the same now.7/7 Update:I just talked to their developers and confirmed that their architectures are nearly the same, except that in SoVITS you can select which content encoder to use (HuBERT or ContentVec).
I drew a graph to illustrate the model of RVC:
"
Unstable Progressive GAN Training with Exploding Gradients when Fading in New Layers,"
I'm trying to implement and train a Progressive GAN for TensorFlow (to generate faces like the CelebA dataset), following along with the original paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.10196.pdf), as well as occasionally referring to this video guide for implementing it in PyTorch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkQHASviYac
However, after entire days of trying, I can't manage to get a stabilized training until the end. For now I'm going only until 64x64 images, but training often destabilizes as soon as I start fading in a layer. Weird thing is that the training restabilizes one epoch later if I just add a layer abruptly. This at first led me to believe that there must be some operation that is failing to get gradients properly because of the way I am calculating the fadein, and this was supported by some asserts being caught showing that weights are being updated to NaN. However, after a correction in my call() functions for both networks, those errors disappeared (unless I try to add spectral normalization, for whatever reason). Now, training just seems to be just unstable and the issues I'm facing might be exploding gradients, and I'm honestly just really confused.
I'm wondering if someone experienced can see some obvious errors in how I'm implementing this progressive GAN which is leading to problems with calculating gradients, paying key attention to how I'm fading in new layers and adding them with the previous ones, or if there's general architecture problems leading to instability.
Any help or tips would be appreciated, thank you so much in advance.

How to fine-tune a pre-trained model for customer service like tasks chatbot?,"
I want to make a trainable conversational bot that can respond to customer service questions. The bot should be able to adapt to different domains based on the dataset provided by the user (a company data science engineer).
I have a general idea of how to approach this problem, but I need some guidance and feedback. My plan is to start from a pre-trained model like Flan T5, GPT, etc. Then, I would do an intermediate fine-tuning on a general conversational dataset like PersonaChat or DailyDialog. Finally, I would do a final fine-tuning on the customer service conversation dataset from the user.
Is this a reasonable approach? What are some potential challenges or pitfalls that I should be aware of? What are some best practices or resources for fine-tuning conversational models? Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.

What if we drop the causal mask in auto-regressive Transformer?,"
I understand the triangular causal mask in the attention is used to prevent tokens from ""looking into the future"", but why do we want to prevent that?
Let's suppose we have a model with context length $T = 8$. At inference time, we want to predict the 5th token with the previous 4 ones, so we truncate the upper-left submatrix and the causal mask looks like the following
[1, 0, 0, 0]
[1, 1, 0, 0]
[1, 1, 1, 0]
[1, 1, 1, 1]

In this case, the model has no access to the 5th token because we did not feed it into the model in the first place, so it certainly cannot cheat by peeking ahead at the ground truth. Why do we still need the causal mask?
Moreover, the second row [1, 1, 0, 0] prevents the 2nd token from ""attending to"" the 3rd and 4th tokens. This makes sense if we are trying to predict the 3rd token, but we are actually predicting the 5th one. Why don't we allow available tokens to attend to each other?

Policy Value network predictions in Alpha Zero with ranked rewards,"
So I have been trying to implement the ranked rewards (R2) algorithm from the paper ""Ranked Reward: Enabling Self-Play Reinforcement Learning for Combinatorial Optimization"" http://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01672 The idea is to leverage the very successful 2 player setting from Alpha Zero to the single player setting for combinatorial optimization.
Instead of getting positive/negative reward for winning/losing the game against the opponent, the (single) agent here gets positive/negative reward for performing better/worse than itself in a certain percentage of previous games.
This is achieved by replacing the final_reward with a ranked_reward in the training example triplets (state, mcts_action_probabilities, final_reward) -> (state, mcts_action_probabilities, ranked_reward) where ranked_reward = 1 if final_reward is larger than a certain percentile of past rewards, and -1 otherwise.
Now here is where I am stuck: replacing the final_reward with the ranked_reward in the training examples means that the neural network learns to predict the ranked_reward from a current state, rather than the actual game reward. On the other hand, inside the neural network guided MCTS, upon leaf expansion, the neural network is used to estimate the final reward from the leaf. But if that neural network has learned to predict only if it is going to be better or worse than itself in previous games, there is a mismatch between neural network predicted rewards and actual state rewards you get from the states during MCTS simulation (e.g. when reaching a terminal state), which - I would think - messes up the tree exploration based on the estimated rewards.
How should this be dealt with? In the paper they just state in Algorithm 1: Perform a Monte Carlo tree search consisting of S simulations guided by fθk but they don't mention the problem of two kinds of rewards at all. Only for the final reward at the end of the actual game (not MCTS simulation for one step) they say to convert to ranked reward.
My guess is that MCTS should be done totally in ranked_reward units, i.e. every reward returned by any state should be converted to ranked_reward inside the MCTS simulation. Only at the end of the actual played game, the final obtained state's actual final reward should be added to the buffer. In other words, evaluating the final state of a game is the only time we ever consider real final rewards rather than ranked_rewards. Is this correct?

Is this a valid application of Autoencodeers/VAE?,"
I am trying to predict a spectrum (1D vector) from various scalar inputs which are known to be correlated. As the spectrum vector is very long (4000 points) it was suggested that I use dimensionality reduction, rather than trying to produce a NN which has a 4000 output size. So, train an autoencoder on the spectra, encode the spectra, then use a neural network to predict the encoded spectra from the various inputs, and then reconstruct the spectra by decoding the predicted encoded spectra.
It was further suggested to me that
A VAE would be a better solution here than an autoencoder, as the structure of the encoded spectra may make it easier for the neural network to learn.
I should use a KL-Divergence term on the output of the neural network predicting the encoded spectra. Not sure on the justification of this one.
Are either of these points valid? Or, indeed, is the use of an autoencoder the way to go here at all? I should ay we are also data limited (around 700 points total).
I have already given it a bit of a go with a little bit of success, but I wanted to check if this is a good way forward before investing too much time/resource

How do you define an action space for a card game with an unlimited and variable hand size?,"
I'm new to the world of AI and have been primarily reading through the documentation for OpenAI's Gym/Gymnasium in hopes of training an AI to play a board game. One piece of information I haven't been able to find is the best way to define an action space when the number of possible actions is countably infinite.
For instance, I've seen several examples of simple games where the player must choose a card to play from their hand. In all of these, the hand has a maximum size, and the action space is discrete with its cardinality being the largest possible hand size. But what if there is no theoretical limit to the size of the player's hand? Let's say a player starts with a hand of seven cards, but the number of cards in their hand could grow (or shrink) to any natural number throughout the course of the game. How would one go about defining the action space in this scenario?
I've thought of four potential ways to handle this:

Define one action for every possible card and mask the action space so that only cards in the player's hand are legal actions. This would mean 52 actions for a standard deck of playing cards, which doesn't seem so bad. But for certain games, there could be many more kinds of unique cards (potentially thousands in the case of trading card games), and I could see the action space becoming unwieldy in those situations.
Define a continuous action space on the interval [0,1] and partition it equally into however many cards are in the player's hand. For example, if there are 10 cards in the hand, an action in [0,0.1) would play the first card, one in [0.1,0.2) would play the second, and so on. I'm unsure if this would be a wise setup since ""nearby"" actions like 0.09 and 0.11 wouldn't necessarily correspond to similar results because cards 1 and 2 aren't ordered in a meaningful way.
Define two actions: one for playing a card and the other for passing. Loop through each card in the hand and apply the action to each one until the ""play"" action is used. In this case, I'm not sure if the AI would be able to ""look ahead"" to know that a better card is coming up so therefore it should pass on the current card.
Pick an arbitrarily large hand limit that a player would never reach in practice and define a discrete number of actions up to that limit.

Would any of these approaches work? Are any favored over the others? Are there other ways of approaching this that I haven't thought of?

Common technique to induce a parser?,"
I am interested in running a simple but hopefully rigorous algorithm which “learns” how to parse HTML - ideally optimally fast.
I have never done this before and I’m wondering if there’s a go-to algorithm or library for this.
I would prefer to start with an extremely simple algorithm even if it is not fast or efficient - but effective. Something like, I give it a corpus of perfect HTML with no errors, and it should generate every possible parsing “hypothesis”, and score each one.
Maybe a simple way to represent a successful “parse” (for a first version of the project) is just the insertion of spaces between HTML language elements.
So, let’s say the model may receive HTML like
< html >      text     </ html >
and
<html>text</html> (or something like that, anyway),
through trial and error it should have generated every possible arrangement of characters in ASCII/UTF-8, and build a tree of states depending on what it gets in some given input string. If it gets “a”, maybe the result has any other letter as of identical decision-relevance, but a “<“ as a different branch on the decision tree (or a cyclical decision graph)?
I’m completely new to this and excited to finally be trying out simple, deterministic, optimizing grammar induction, which I have been learning about for the last 6 months and finally would like to try.

What are the most common fault prediction algorithms?,"
I have to predict a fault (automotive related) as much in advance as possible.
Right now I have found a solution that is somewhat satisfactory (a good number of true positives and a low number of false positives) but it doesn't feel optimal.
I know that usually this fault appears when a variable X drops (although it's not always a fault when X drops).
For each fault (time t0) of each vehicle in the training dataset I have found the moment (t-k) when the drop of X starts. I have set the target variable y to 1 from t-k to t0. y is 0 anywhere else.
Using XGBoost I then predict y.
The problem now is that I have multiple predictions  for each fault (one for each record) and I need to group them somehow.
To send the alert I could simply take the first prediction equal to 1 for each fault of each vehicle, but by doing so I would have too many false positives.
The solution I am using right now groups predictions using a ""manual"" logic: there must be a minimum number of predictions equal to 1 in the last hours, there must be a minimum ratio of predictions equal to 1 compared to predictions equal to 0, variable X cannot be higher than a certain threshold (because if it's not dropping it shouldn't be a fault), etc.
But by doing so I have to find the optimal combination of these parameters (with a grid search) and it doesn't feel like it's the right way to do it.
Can anyone share a better way to do this?

Q learning achieves small reward in simple dice game,"
I am trying to train a Q learning agent on the following game: The states are parametrised by an integer $S \geq 0$ (representing the sum of the previous die rolls). In each step the player can choose to roll a die or quit the game. Whenever the player rolls a six, the game terminates with 0 reward. Otherwise, the player updates $S \to S+$number of eyes. If the player chooses to terminate, they receive $S$ as a reward.
The most natural strategy is to choose a threshold $t$ and decide to roll the die whenever $S \leq t$. I believe the optimal $t$ (ie maximising expected value) is $1+2+3+4+5 = 15$. In simulations, the $t=15$ strategy achieves an expected value of around 6. A standard Q learning agent achieves 2.1 reward and a double Q agent (as in the original Hasselt paper) around 2.5.
Is such a low performance to be expected? Is there a variant of Q learning that would perform much better? Or did I probably make a mistake in the implementation or choice hyperparameters (learning rate= 0.6, training episodes = 10000, $\gamma$ = 0.95)?

Is it a big difference when you save your model differently? for example h5 vs savedmodel or tensorflow vs pytorch.
Is it possible for me to read meaningful information from any saved files regardless of the format? So it doesn't matter if someone else used Pytorch, Tensorflow, or C to do ML

$\gamma^t$ in REINFORCE update (Sutton-Barto RL book Exercise 13.2),"
I've struggled with solving exercise 13.2 from Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction Second Edition :

Generalize the box on page 199, the policy gradient theorem (13.5),
the proof of the policy gradient theorem (page 325), and the steps
leading to the REINFORCE update equation (13.8), so that (13.8) ends
up with a factor of $\gamma^t$ and thus aligns with the general algorithm given
in the pseudocode.

Below is my attempt. Please let me know if this is correct or where I've made a mistake (exercise 13.2 was was not in the authors' official solutions when I checked).
Generalize box on 199
As explained in the box on 199, include a factor of $\gamma$  in the second term of (9.2):
$$
\eta_\gamma(s) = h(s) + \gamma \sum_{\overline{s}} \eta(\overline{s}) \sum_a \pi(a|\overline{s}) p(s|\overline{s},a)
$$
$$
\mu_\gamma(s) = \frac{\eta_\gamma(s)}{\sum_{s^\prime} \eta(s^\prime)}
$$
I initially thought the definition of $\mu_\gamma(s)$ was
$$
\mu_\gamma(s) = \frac{\eta_\gamma(s)}{\sum_{s^\prime} \eta_\gamma(s^\prime)}
$$
but I could not see how to finish the exercise with this definition. Given that we are assuming a single starting state $s_0$, we can also write $\eta_\gamma(s)$ as:
$$
\eta_\gamma(s) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k Pr(s_0 \rightarrow s, k, \pi)

Is AI just a bunch of library functions?,"
Recently, I began reading more about AI and took a few basic courses to learn the basics of how it works. I also started a few projects involving AI, but get bored very quickly. To me, it feels like creating an AI project just feels like finding a dataset and throwing a bunch of library functions at it until it works. And tuning hyperparameters is even worse -- I make one small change and then have to wait for a long time before I can see what my change even did.
My main frustration is that I'm not actually building anything -- I'm just plugging in data to a bunch of functions and hoping it works. It doesn't feel like science or coding at all.
I'm not sure if this is a common issue or not -- maybe I'm just going about the entire process wrong? In any case, please let me know what projects I can do that are more interesting, or if I just need to reevaluate my approach to AI.
","['definitions', 'ai-field']","Is AI just a bunch of library functions?No.Your experience with online learning - I would guess via MOOC such as Andrew Ng's Coursera courses - is typical though, due to limitations of automated grading systems, the assessment of your ability to build systems is usually reduced to you filling in a few key functions and data structures in an already-built project.However, library functions are going to exist for anything generalisable in any large technical field. Unreal Engine automates a whole bunch of interesting and difficult problems that crop up in 3D games. Ruby on Rails codifies a lot of common design approaches in web development. Same is true in AI with libraries such as TensorFlow, PyTorch and scikit-learn.To users of these systems who care about the results to effort ratio, this is a good thing. It can be a double-edged sword when it comes to getting a deeper understanding though, and it also means that a lot of low-hanging fruit has already been picked, in terms of improving the state of the industry as a whole.Whether or not this is boring depends on you, what you find interesting, and what you hope to achieve. There is no requirement that you do find AI or machine learning (ML) interesting. ML is essentially automated statistics and function-fitting routines, and is a large part of many modern AI approaches. AI as a whole is far more than that, but is such a large subject that typically you would work on a specialism within it, and would need to do so if you ever hope to hit an ""edge"" of it where you were performing original R&D or academic research.My main frustration is that I'm not actually building anything -- I'm just plugging in data to a bunch of functions and hoping it works.

There's no guarantee you will find them interesting.My first impression from your description of your frustration is that you have been learning with toy systems that don't do anything that you care about.

That could be:To me, it feels like creating an AI project just feels like finding a dataset and throwing a bunch of library functions at it until it worksThis is often used in learning environments, and suggested as a way to hone skills in ML. That's because preparing data for use in ML is  hard work. In reality Data Science work can be 90% about understanding and obtaining useful data sets for a specific problem, and only 10% anaylsis and training models - training the models can be seen as the ""easy and fun"" part.There are also a bunch of key understandings about how statistics works that you need to have in order to use the library functions. A typical beginner probelm in ML is not understanding the need to check for generalisation by using cross-validation and test sets, how they should be used, and how to spot and avoid data leaks. Simply taking some data, throwing it into a library function and getting ""99% accuracy"" is a major problem that comes with lack of understanding."
How does vocabulary size affect quality?,"
I think the vocabulary size in LLMs makes two trade-offs:

The bigger tokens you have, the less frequent they will be.
The more tokens you have, the more parameters you dedicate to input and output.

I'm looking for a chart of the effect of the tokenizer vocabulary size on some quality metric. It could be a chart with a fixed number of total parameters, so both trade-offs have an impact on quality. Or it could be a chart where the architecture is fixed and the number of parameters grows with vocabulary size, to only show the first trade-off.
The best I could find is this chart from Impact of Tokenization on Language Models: An Analysis for Turkish. But it only shows increasing quality. Surely at some point increasing the vocabulary starts to have a negative effect on quality?

For example I want to have a chat bot for pizza ordering.
So far I assume that I need (I'm not sure):

Context Question Answering (questions about menu, pizzas)
Entity Recognition (ordering some pizza)

Questions:

What should development process look like for this kind of neural network?
Should it be custom model from a scratch or existing model?
What about language translations of existing model - is it possible to translate text model to another language? We are talking about languages with similar grammar, so translation of words should be enough, but how to do it?

"Take action only at the beginning of the episode, not during each step","
I am working in an reinforcement learning environment with 1-dimensional action space. My action is only used at the first timestep of an episode and never again. In other word the action only affects the agent's behavior at timestep 1 and is not used at any of the later timesteps.
To illustrate my specific case, here is an image of my enviroment:

At step 0 red ball recives the action (force at a certain angle) and starts moving. At each timestep the coordinates of the red and blue ball are computed, but we cannot interfere with the enviroment anymore (the final configuration is already determined by the initail impulse and the physics).
Should I make each step an episode so the action will be always applied at each step ? (i.e., should I consider a step the transition between the initial position of the balls and the their final position?).
I am new to reinforcement learning so I apologize if this is a silly question

Variable observation space at each episode,"
I have an enviroment with continuous actions and state variables. Every time I reset my env, between 2 and 5 balls spawn randomly in a box of 100x100 size. One of those balls (the red one) will receive an action (direction of movement) and will move according to some physics. This ball will always spawn.
Notice that the observation space only changes when we reset and start a new episode (when we move a step in time the observation space size remains the same). An example of my env:


Action space: the angle that we want to move the red ball
Observation space: the coordinates of the blue balls

The problem is that sometimes there will be only one blue ball, or two, or three... so the number of 2D coordinates in the observation will change.
Most of the reinforcement learning techniques have a fixed size state spaces, how can I deal with my dynamic size observation space and apply algorithms such as AC2, PPO, ... ? Should I consider an observation space with the maximum number of balls and make 0 the coordinates of the ones that didn't spawn ?

How do language models know what they don't know - and report it?,"
Again and again I ask myself what goes on in a pre-trained transformer-based language model (like ChatGPT9) when it comes to ""know"" that it cannot give an appropriate answer and either

states it (""I have not enough information to answer this question."")

asks for more specific information (""Please tell me which kind of XY you mean."")

calls a plugin (like Wolfram or ScholarAI)


(I assume that this will never happen without reinforcement learning by human feedback. A pre-trained-only model would always answer something (possibly hallucinating) and not ""reflect"" about its lack of knowledge.)
The only possibility that I can see - but it's not really explanatory: that after some steps of execution the sum of the top_k probabilities of the final vector (which gives probabilities to the all words in the vocabulary) is too small. But what, when this happens only late? ChatGPT would already have produced lots of words - but one never observes that he stops generation after some lengthy text and only then ends with something like ""Ah, finally I see that I'm missing information. I wasn't aware in the beginning."" ChatGPT immediately admits that he doesn't know (when he does). And when ChatGPT calls a plugin - e.g. ScholarAI - he does it without having produced a single word of response to the last message.
In principle, ChatGPT could generate a complete response in the background that then is checked somehow if it's ""satisfactory"". If yes it's given as output (simulating word-by-word generation), if not, it's regenerated with some sort of trigger (a hidden token?) to admit that ChatGPT is missing information or to call a plugin.
What's the clever trick under the hood (in some technical detail)?

I'm a relatively newbie in this world of Artificial Intelligence, although I am able to use frameworks such as Tensorflow and also understand the general concepts behind training weights and parameters, I wonder about a lot of stuff.

So is it necessary that people use frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch to do ML
And what do people do before frameworks were introduced?

","['machine-learning', 'training', 'tensorflow', 'pytorch', 'models']","Before discussing ""why"", let's look at what is an ML framework:Simply put, an ML framework is a collection of abstractions that allow you to build ML models. If you are from a software engineering background, you may think of them as libraries with built - in modules to accomplish common ML related tasks, including but not limited to:For example, Keras is a popular Deep learning library with many 'ready to use' components.To understand why you need a framework, you should have a basic understanding of what building an ML solution entails:Let's see how a framework helps at each stage:Stages 1, 2 : Major Deeplearning frameworks provide you with very easy to use interfaces for loading and processing data. These are generally as simple as making a few lines of core API calls.For example, in PyTorch, loading the famous MNIST database is as simple asWithout such a simple API, you would be writing a ton of code to manually fetch, download, extract, copy / load your dataset.Stage 3: These DL frameworks also provide you easy interfaces to manipulate underlying Tensors in memory. (Essentially mostDL Models can be decomposed into Matrices/Tensors). This is by far the single largest reason, i.e. Deeplearning Frameworks are capable of moving and manipulating these Tensors in GPUs. And you my be well aware about how much Compute Power ML Models need. GPUs are especially good at handling parallel processing tasks. (For example, you may take say 10,000 dimension Tensor and add a single number to it. Conventional programming would involve running a for loop to iterate over each individual element, whereas GPUs can process the entire Tensor parallely)Stage 4: Finally, most DL frameworks also provide you means to deploy your trained model into production. (Although, this is a debatable topic as many people argue that it's better to re - write the model in performant languages like C++ before deploying to production)Well, these popular DL Frameworks per se did not exist a decade ago, but we have had libraries and packages that attempt to perform some of the above tasks.For example, the popular python package Numpy provided the capability of operating over nd arrays long before Tensorflow came into picture.As AI Expert Andrej Karpathy pointed out, during his academic journey, before GPU accelerated frameworks, he relied on tools like MATLAB to perform his experiments.For most cases, it's better to use a framework as it will save you a great deal of pain.If, however you want to learn the fundamentals of machine learning, down to the individual tensor and how it is manipulated, it might be useful to implement a Neural Network from scratch without any libraries (you might still need to use stuff like Numpy, or go full on hardcore C/C++ )"
Why is it said transformers are more parallelizable than RNN's?,"
The parallelization of transformers and RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) is often discussed. It's commonly said that transformers are more parallelizable than RNNs. However, this is a rather vague statement that merits further discussion.
One could argue that an RNN can be made as parallelizable as desired by simply adding more instances to each batch.
What is generally meant by saying transformers are more parallelizable is that transformers lack time-dependent operations. In other words, given an input, all operations can be done at once (although not all, since one layer needs to be computed before the next).
Contrast this with an RNN, where computations from one time step are carried forward and used in the next. Some people argue that this time-dependence makes RNNs less parallelizable.
However, one could also argue that to achieve a level of parallelization in an RNN similar to that in a transformer, one could simply increase the batch size by a factor equal to the number of time steps in the sequence. This way, both the transformer and the RNN would perform the same training in the same time frame.
A potential counterpoint to this argument might be that this would increase the memory requirements for the RNN, as the entire unfolding of the network needs to be stored. However, the memory requirement for an RNN grows linearly with the size of the input, whereas for a transformer, it grows quadratically.
Therefore, one could argue that, given their linear memory growth, RNNs should actually require less memory than transformers, making them just as parallelizable.
I look forward to getting some clarity on this issue. Does the parallelization advantage of transformers over RNNs lie in something more than just memory and time-step computations?
I understand there might be other reasons why to choose a transformer over a RNN, for instance the vanishing gradient problem, but I'm particularly interested in the statement ""Transformers are more parallelizable than RNN's"" because it doesn't seem obvious to me why this would be true.
There might also be good reasons for not wanting to increase the batch size, I'm interested on that too.

Exploring NLP Techniques for Transforming Web Content into Engaging Q&A Formats,"

Tedious manual copy-pasting
Token limitations
Irrelevant or unhelpful questions
Loss of original formatting
Potential hallucinations

I'm seeking an NLP-based solution with the following characteristics:

User-friendly, preferably as a browser extension
Quick activation via click or keyboard shortcut
No token limit
Generation of meaningful questions
Integration of questions with corresponding answers
Preservation of the original webpage's appearance
Use of existing text for answers

Based on previous suggestions, I've considered an approach that involves:

Extracting webpage text using Mozilla's Readability
Generating questions with Haystack's QuestionGenerator
Locating answers using Haystack's Reader
Inserting questions and answers into the webpage's DOM

However, I'm eager to explore alternative ideas and techniques. Are there other NLP-powered tools or methodologies that could effectively accomplish this objective? I appreciate any insights or recommendations!

Normalisation in feature extraction using pre-trained model,"
I have a dataset with medical images. I want to implement a network for super-resolution using GANs. One of the criteria of the optimisation is a perceptual loss. For that I will use a pretrained vgg network, trained on imagenet solely to extract features. Essentially, this vgg network is used as a feature extractor. I feed my network with data normalized with the medical dataset statistics. Therefore the output are images with the dataset statistics as well.
When I want to extract features from the output of my network should I simply pass the output of my network to the vgg since it is already normalized with the medical dataset statistics or do I need to denormalize back the network output and then normalize with the imagenet statistics?

"At what text-based tasks are ""dumb humans"" still better than the best language models?","
I ran into this AI-SE question from 5 years ago and I believe that an updated version could be interesting to discuss nowadays: Is the smartest robot more clever than the stupidest human?
Today's best LLMs are displaying a lot of human-like abilities: proficiency in natural languages, ability to code, logical reasoning, role playing and so on. They can even solve CAPTCHAs, design games, answer questions about stories or write new ones: these were the ""shortcomings of robots"" in 2018, according to the answers to the question I linked.
Question
How do the best LLMs of today compare to a ""dumb human""? In what tasks are all normal humans still better than AIs? Is there any test that every able-bodied human would pass, but top LLMs would still fail?
Definitions and clarifications
A ""dumb human"" is a person without recognized disabilities or obvious problems, who doesn't have particular skills and who is considered not very intelligent (low IQ).
Of course the LLMs available to the public have a number of objective limitations: they can only process text-to-text, they work with tokens rather than characters, context length is just few kilo-tokens, and they have no long-term memory. However a number of open source projects have shown various solutions to these problems, and the non-public version of the commercial LLMs already support much larger context windows, image input and similar features. Observations like ""LLMs can't move arms as they don't have it"", ""LLMs fail to count characters because they're token based"", ""LLMs can't speak nor listen to speech"" are not interesting.
","['human-like', 'intelligence-testing', 'reasoning', 'intelligence']","LLMs seem to be limited at ""compositional tasks."" Have a look at this paper, in which the authorsinvestigate the limits of these models across three representative compositional tasks—multi-digit multiplication, logic grid puzzles, and a classic dynamic programming problem. These tasks require breaking problems down into sub-steps and synthesizing these steps into a precise answer.I don't know if a ""dumb human"" can do dynamic programming problems, buthumans can solve 3-digit by 3-digit multiplication arithmetic after learning basic calculation rules. Yet, off-the-shelf ChatGPT and GPT4 achieve only 55% and 59% accuracies on this task, respectively.I gave ChatGPT two tries (what is ""311 times 877"") and (""what is 513 times 799""), and it got them both wrong.Another example from that paper is a ""zebra"" or ""einstein"" puzzle. Look at page 18 in the paper for an example. (I'll copy it below) It took me a couple minutes to solve. ChatGPT tries its best, but gets it quite wrong.There are 3 houses (numbered 1 on the left, 3 on the right). Each has a different person in them.

Early binary classification of timeseries,"
I'm trying to figure out how to solve this problem that I'll try to explain in the next few lines. I have a timeseries of length ~200k values and every 700 points I have a label that indicates the status of the signal. In this medical problem every 700 points I know if the signal is in a pathological or healthy status. The goal of the framework I want to implement is to understand if I can correctly predict, early in time, if the signal is going to be pathological in order to raise warning.
I have tried different approach so far, but none of them really works. For example I have tried to classify using a sliding window of size 700 and predict the label in the ""classic"" way with different classifier. In order to implement early prediction I simply shifted the labels backwards (i.e. 1st sliding window in input and label of the next 700 point). Actually I did not consider the signals as a timeseries but always as vectors not related in time.
Can someone give me some tips on how I can solve this problem considering the time factor ?

"Why shouldn't the attention matrices $W^Q$, $W^K$, $W^V$ be the same?","
My question is why the attention head matrices $W^Q$, $W^K$, $W^V$ should not be the same $W = W^Q =W^K= W^V$. In my understanding of transformer-based language models  one attention head is responsible for one syntactic or semantic relation between any two words in the context. One might think that such a relation is represented by one matrix $W$ that projects the full word embeddings $x_i$ from their full semantic space to a semantic subspace responsible for this relation. Here we could - in principle - calculate scores $\sigma_{ij}$ as ""similiarities"" between two projected words $Wx_i$ and $Wx_j$ and then calculate the weighted sum of the projected tokens $Wx_k$.
I wonder why this would not work, and why we need three different matrices.
Another way around: What does it mean to calculate the score as the dot-product of two vectors from two different semantic subspaces? Is this still some kind of similiarity (which lies at the heart of word embeddings)? And doesn't it sound like comparing apples and pears?
Or viewed differently: How similar are the three matrices of an attention head in practice, e.g. when considering some 100$\times$100 attention heads of a large transformer model like ChatGPT?

If single-agent RL algorithms such as Q-learning is applied to multi-agent systems (e.g. Markov games), the environment from the perspective of the agent is non-stationary, and the agent is faced with a moving target problem, that is, the optimal policy changes as other agents' policies changes. I understand this as the optimal Q-function, $Q^*(s,a)$, being the moving target, since the optimal Q-function depends on other agents' policies.
If the agent learns in the space of the joint action space, then according to several references, the environment is stationary from the perspective of any agent, even though the agents' policies may change over time. Suppose the goal of the agent is to learn a joint optimal policy defined as a Nash equilibrium, from which it bases its actions on. Then, the agent tries to find an optimal Q-function defined as $Q_{{\pi^*}}(s,\textbf{a})$, where a denotes the joint action and $\pi^*$ denotes the joint optimal policy. I would then conclude that $Q_{{\pi^*}}(s,\textbf{a})$ is no longer a moving target, since we are in the space of joint policies, and thereby account for other agents' policies explicitly.
So as I understand it, non-stationarity and the moving target problem are two sides of the same coin. Is this correctly understood? Or can the environment be stationary while the problem is still a moving-target?

Feature extraction from log-mel spectrograms using CNNs,"
I am currently working on an ASR-related project in which I would like to combine Convolutional Neural Network with GRU Network and CTC loss function.
The idea is to use the CNN to extract representative features from log-mel spectrograms, and then pass the resulting feature maps as input to the GRU network, after first reducing the dimensions of the maps to (Batch Size x C = 1 x H x W).
I have read the publications on this topic, but I have not found information on whether such a solution makes sense. I know that log-mel spectrograms contain features extracted from audio files, but I would like to make the features more meaningful.
I was planning to use the feature extraction module from the VGG-16 network, but my spectrograms have dimensions of 1x23xW, where W ranges from 600 to 1500 (I made the padding up to the maximum width in the batch), and I cannot then use this module to fine-tune the model and apply it to the GRU because of the discrepancy in the dimensions of the images.
Can you tell me what kind of CNN to use to extract features from spectrograms of such dimensions? I would also appreciate knowing if it makes sense to use CNNs in such a case.

This is my biggest problem, how would I get all the information from the frames? This is the first time doing something with image recognition.
I program a QAgent with a Q Table with my actions as columns and the information I extracted from the frames as my rows. Because these are probably continuous, I need to discretize them.
After that I update the Q Table in every t step.

How to handle BatchNorm in the last layers of Neural Networks?,"
I am creating a neural network using batchnorm as a regularization method to enable deep models and prevent overfitting.
I understand that batchnorming supresses the internal covariance shift introduced by randomly chosen minibatches, so it generally makes sense to add it to every layer in the model. However, the batchnorm also introduces noise into the training data, which has a particularly heavy effect on model output in the last few layers of the model.
How exactly should I handle the batchnorm at the end of my model? It seems intuitive that the last layer should not be batchnormed, as this would reduce the degrees of freedom for the output of the model and shift the outputs uncontrollably. But what about the penultimate layer and those before? Would it make sense to ""lighten"" the effects of the minibatch for example by reducing its impact gradually? Or is it better to just completely leave it out after some layer?

This is a conceptual gap that I have concerning embeddings, and would really appreciate some help closing it.
I understand when you embed a corpus for, let's say, a question-and-answer task you can then encode your query to find documents within your corpus that are nearest to the query in the embedding space, using something like cosine distance, and retrieve an answer, with a source being the document in your corpus from which it got the answer.
This to me is a ""one-dimensional"" embedding task - you chunk your corpus documents into lists of sentences for embeddings. The resulting list of embeddings is then a (NxM)-dimensional matrix, where N is your number of chunks you feed in, and M is functionally the number of unique tokens in your corpus.

However, for my project, I am trying to embed multiple text fields about public companies to later search and compare them - like a long description (1-2 paragraphs in length), their industry (1-2 words in length), and their sector (1-2 words).
I would think this is a ""3-dimensional"" embedding task, because we have three separate text fields that we embed. So for TSLA, we'd have a (NxMx3) tensor with embeddings for each of the three fields? How would the semantic search in this case work?
When performing semantic search, should I just try to search over all three groups of embeddings? If so, what might that look like? Or should I concatenate the embeddings somehow (kind of 'flattening')
Thank you in advance for any help

What is the best approach to remove this additional container from the cropped image?,"
I'm working on a computer vision application in Python to analyze images of ice cream cuttings to measure the amount of variegate(ie. fruit syrup or fudge) compared to the base ice cream. My approach is to crop the ice cream, generate a mask including only the cropped image (removing any additional background after cropping), transform the image, and finally count black pixels (variegate) compared to white pixels(ice cream base). The results can be seen in the first picture
I'm using the rembg package and remove function with the code seen below for my cropping:
from rembg import remove
image_crop = rembg.remove(image)
image_crop_arr = np.array(image_crop, dtype=np.uint8)

The problem is that the remove function is including the ice cream container(see the picture above), and if the photo is not taken vertically a fair bit of the container is included. This throws off my calculations and color scale for transforming.
What is the best approach to remove this additional container from the cropped image?

Train a custom CNN to generate masks (sounds like a lot of work)?
Increase the edge factor to remove say 10 extra pixels from the cropped line?
Modify the remove function and its U2 training?
Are there other simple approaches I'm not considering

I tried drawing a rectangular mask around the center of the image to capture the ice cream and remove the container, but the ice cream is not rectangular, introducing an error.
I annotated 30 or so images with the idea of making a custom mask to train an image cropping algorithm to better select the shape of the ice cream cutting from the background and ice cream container, which is seen in the image below. Is this a good approach to take for training a custom model? If so how many more annotated photos do you think a CNN or other model would required? I can only buy and eat so much ice cream. :)

Thank you for any feedback!!!

How to apply backpropagation when one layer of the network is a call-only function (no gradient)?,"
I worked with Feed Forward Neural Network and VAE and understood backpropagation algorithm. Now I build a VAE network, one layer of it is a very complex vector-to-vector function $f(x)$ (a general 'method' in the programming sense instead of a 'math' expression).
Thus, there is no gradient info for this layer. I guess one cannot train the entire network with such a gap, though other layers are differentiable. Is there any nice way to train such a network?
One thing in my mind is to approximate the gradient by slightly changing $x$ and computing
$$
\frac{f(x+\delta)-f(x)}{ \delta}

Can transformer models be used to convert code from one programming language to another?,"
There was a question like this in 2019. I hope things have changed since then.
Concretely, I am looking for a way to train a transformer model to convert code from SAS to Python. I guess the method does not depend on the pair of programming languages requested as long as one has enough data for training.
There are paid tools, e.g. CodeConert and sas2py, that do this, but I can not find out what the are based on and how they were built.
It appears that one (very bad) way could be to use interpreters that translate one programming language, e.g. Java, to English and then from English to the second programming language, e.g. Python. This must be very prone to mistakes and seems like a wrong approach.

Finding an optimal action score function for Multi-Armed Bandit Problem,"
Considering a multi-armed bandit problem where there are :
C: number of machines
T: timesteps
m(i) , v(i) = mean and variance of i-th machine's reward distribution
A(i) = Selected Machine index at timestep i
R(i) = Received Reward at timestep i : ~ N(m(A(i)),v(A(i))

(all indexes start from 1)

If we decide to follow this policy:

For steps i = 1 to C selecting machine i in other words A(i) = i for i <= C
For steps i > C selecting machine which has  the highest score (Z is score function) : Z(j, i , R(1 to i-1), A(1 to i-1)) where j is machine's index and i is timestep

So we would have our expectation for the total reward as :
$$
\mathbb{E}[R_{total}] = \sum_{i=1}^T{\mathbb{E}[R(i)]} = \sum_{i=1}^C{m(i)} + \sum_{i=C+1}^T{\sum_{j=1}^C{m(j)*Pr(A(i) = j)}}
$$
And also we have:
$$
Pr(A(i) = j) = \prod_{k \neq j}{Pr( Z(\textbf{j}, i , R([1... i-1]), A([1... i-1])) >Z(\textbf{k}, i , R([1... i-1]), A([1...i-1])))} 
$$
so we have this objective of finding unknown function Z which maximizes $\mathbb{E}[R_{total}]$:
$$
\DeclareMathOperator*{\argmax}{arg\,max}
Z = \argmax_{Z()}{\mathbb{E}[R_{total}]} = \argmax_{Z}{\sum_{i=C+1}^T{\sum_{j=1}^C{m(j)*Pr(A(i) = j)}}}
$$
(I purned out first term in $\mathbb{E}[R_{total}]$ since it is a constant)
I know there are well-known techniques like UCB, epsilon-greedy ,... however I think there should be an optimal Z function even if we dont have any information about mean and variance of reward distributions, because at least we know that they are normally distributed in this case.
My questions are :

Is there any well known technique to solve such problems ? where
we don't have any specific form for the function which we are trying
to find ?
Is my assumption correct about existence of an optimal Z function ?

Why skip gram doesnt just use the probabilities as the encoded vector?,"
I am very confused but this is what's on my head now:

The skip-gram algorithm just multiplies hot-encoded-words with a weights-matrix,
and since the word is hot encoded it is just multiplying a row of the matrix
And so this matrix W will end up being the probabilities that we are predicting, or at least will be ordered in the same way.

So what's the advantage of this algorithm? What exactly is figuring out?
Wouldnt just a probability vector for each word, computed from the neighbours in a huge pool of words serve the same purpose without any optimization?

How to Change the Length of a Sequence Using Linear Projection In PyTorch?,"
I was trying to reproduce a voice conversion model using PyTorch and I had difficulty implementing a module called PBTC (Parallel Bank of Transposed Convlutions), used in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12197.pdf. As in the paper, it consists of several parallel branches with transposed convlution followed by a linear projection.

The input to this module is a sequence of f0 (fundamental frequency) embeddings with shape [B, T, L]. Basically we want it to pass through the PBTC module and get a new sequence with shape [B, T, F].
As shown in the figure, it first passes through a transposed convolution and get a sequence with shape [B, t', F]. Then it passes through a linear projection and get a sequence with shape [B, T, F].
But the thing is how to define such linear projection? As in the figure, t' is computed using t, dilation dil and kernel size k, where t should be the length of input sequence, T. But we don't exactly know what t is since the length of input sequence varies among different data point. So should I fix the input length, truncating or padding the raw input sequence to fit this length? But this does't seem to make sense...

Not pre-trained binary transformer model,"
I stacked with a problem. My default Transformer model totally does not learn how to evaluate python logical expressions, like: '(False and not True) xor False or (not False and False)'. Model should understand how eval such expressions and return True or False answers. Model after training returns all the time False answer. To test how does my logical expressions generator, tokeniser and custom dataset works, I wrote LSTM model with MultiheadAttention layer. And such LSTM model after training successfully evaluates logical expressions. So all parts in my code works fine, except Transformer model.
So my question is, is it theoretically possible to train an untrained Transformer model to make it a binary classifier?
Because as I correctly understand LSTMs have a sequential nature and are effective in capturing dependencies in sequential data, such as natural language sequences. The LSTM-based model, with the use of bidirectional LSTM layers and attention mechanism, might be able to learn the patterns and dependencies present in the logical expressions more effectively, resulting in accurate evaluations.
On the other hand, transformers are designed to capture global dependencies and are highly effective in tasks involving long-range dependencies. However, they might not be as effective when dealing with sequential data or capturing fine-grained sequential patterns. But I don't see any problems why my Transformer doesn't trained to eval expressions and after that return correct answer.

How can I decide the order of this algorithm? Should we look at which term is dominant with respect to the episode number $K$ or total steps $T=HK$? Then it might be $O(XAH^2\ln K)$

Handcraft RNN with attention to extract central element,"
I am trying to formulate an RNN that uses attention to easily detect the central element of a sequence. For an RNN alone this is not an easy task but with attention, it should be but I am not entirely certain how to design it. The goal of this question is to understand both mechanisms better.

So for example I have (10,20,30) or (10,20,30,40,50) given as input sequence.
At input 30 the RNN should output 20 at position 50 -> 30 and so forth.

My idea for the RNNs hidden state is to just increase it by 1. The hidden state h would just be a scalar.
e.g. (10,20,30) produces the states (1,2,3)
But now I am stuck as attention should work with the input and the hidden state. What I would need as output would be scored (0,1,0) * (10,20,30) = 20.
The scoring function I come up with would be s(h, number, i) = 1 if h/2 == i else 0.
But there I am using the index as an additional parameter / positional encoding and wondering if I can do it without it.

If we can have AIs that can generate entertainment videos with a textual input, couldn't we have AIs that generate full training videos with textual and video inputs?
Perhaps some kind of time code correlated input with screen grabs from the training videos presented in training alongside with text scraped/recognized from the audio track.
I hear that GPT4 is able to train from correlated text/images but I'm having a hard time finding more information about this.
The owner wants to be able to validate/challenge the AI and correct any errors in the resulting output (audio and/or video).  My OpenAI API reading indicates that at least for text based AIs this is now possible.
Is current technology up to this task?   How would a content creator correct an AI that produces incorrect video output ?

Which preprocessing is the correct way to forecast time-series data using LSTM?,"
I just started to study time-series forecasting using RNN.
I have a few months of time series data that was an hour unit.
The data is a kind of percentage value of my little experiment and I would like to forecast the future condition of this.
Many tutorials and web info introduced direct training and forecasting the time series data without any data pre-processing.
But for the RNN (or ML and DL), I think we should consider the data's condition that is stationary or not.
My data is totally random condition which is stationary data (no seasonality, no trend).
For example, the US stock prediction tutorial showed super great accuracy forecasting performance according to many LSTM tutorials.
[If this really works and is true, then all ML developers will be rich.]
And, Some of them didn't emphasize and note a kind of the data pre-processing such as non-stationary to stationary something like that.
According to my short knowledge, I think the non-stationary data such as stock price (will have trend) should be converted as a stationary format through differencing or some other steps. and I think this is a correct prediction as a view of theoretical sense even if the accuracy is not high.
So my point is, I'm a bit confused about whether that really is no need for any preprocessing to treat stationary or not.
For my case, I applied differencing step ($t_n - t_{n-1}$)to my time-series data in order to remove the trend or some periodic situation.

Are the documents in the training data containing accidentally sentence pairs near each other possibly enough?

How big the context can be using HuggingFace models?,"
I'm new on AI, Neural Networks, ChatBots and all this ecosystem. I'm trying to use a classical example of pre-trained models, more specifically timpal0l/mdeberta-v3-base-squad2.
As I could see in the examples, it is necessary to provide a small text (context) and a question, which the model will respond to by extracting information from the context and using training on the structure of the language. This is my working code so far:
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForQuestionAnswering, AutoConfig, DefaultDataCollator
import torch

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(""timpal0l/mdeberta-v3-base-squad2"")
model = AutoModelForQuestionAnswering.from_pretrained(""timpal0l/mdeberta-v3-base-squad2"", return_dict=False )

# From portuguese: My cat is called Helena. She is fat and has spots all over her body.
little_text = ""minha gata se chama helena. Ela é gorda e tem manchas pelo corpo.""

# From portuguese: who is helena?
question = ""quem é helena?""

inputs = tokenizer.encode_plus(question, little_text, add_special_tokens=False, return_tensors=""pt"")

input_ids = inputs[""input_ids""].tolist()[0]

text_tokens = tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids)
answer_start_scores, answer_end_scores = model(**inputs)

answer_start = torch.argmax(
    answer_start_scores
)  
answer_end = torch.argmax(answer_end_scores) + 1

answer = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(tokenizer.convert_ids_to_tokens(input_ids[answer_start:answer_end]))

print(f""Question: {question}"")
print(f""Answer: {answer}\n"")

------------------------------------------------
Question: quem é helena?
Answer: minha gata # From portuguese: My cat 

Everything went well. The model is able to perfectly answer questions about the small text provided as context.
What I couldn't understand is: when I provide a much larger text to serve as context (from a file, for example) the time for the response increases considerably. So every time I go to ask a question about the given text I have to wait a long time to get the answer.
So my question is: Am I doing this correctly? My intention is to create a chatbot to help answer questions about a specific system (a kind of help bot), so I simply copied all the text from the online help and pasted it into a single file but I believe that this method only works for small texts because at every question I must tokenizer.encode_plus(question, little_text ...

"When running reinforcement learning on a language model, how do you prevent the model from just minimizing its logits?","
Suppose you have a pre-trained autoregressive language model, and some cost function C mapping strings to numbers. Lower costs mean a given generated string is ""better"". Pass the model some input sequence and autoregressively generate an output sequence, say by just directly sampling from the model's output distribution at each timestep, for say n timesteps. Now let (l1, ... ln) denote the logits of the tokens selected at timesteps 1 through n. A very simply reinforcement learning objective is
C(y)(l1 + ... + ln)
where C(y) is the cost of the output sequence. In other words, if C(y) is positive (bad output), make those logits smaller, and if C(y) is negative (good output), make the logits bigger.
This seems like a sensible and simple reinforcement learning objective, but when I run it, all I find is that the system just minimizes its logits. These are histograms of the model's output logits at various points during training - as training progresses the histograms move to the left.

Basically the model is tending towards a uniform output distribution, minimizing the loss by minimizing the l1 + ... + ln factor rather than the C(y) factor.
How do SOTA reinforcement learning methods get around this issue?

Closed last month.



I am on a learning phase (still to enter the details but I would like first to get a bird's eye overview). I would like to understand the difference between:
(1) a reinforcement learning framework, with $\gamma=0$, policy gradient optimization, and where the environment presents a new state at every iteration sampled from an input distribution. These conditions define a setup that we call RL0
(2) a standard neural network supervised classification framework. Call this second setup ANN.
To me the setups seem equal if we make the correspondence:

ANN weights <-> RL0 policy parameters
ANN inputs <-> RL0 states
ANN predicted values <-> RL0 deterministic action given the state
ANN loss function for one sample <-> RL0 reward given the state and action

My questions:

Is it really so? In other words can an ANN used in a supervised framework can be seen as a special case of reinforcement learning with a parametrized policy and discounted rewards with $\gamma=0$ ? Or am I missing some fundamental difference?

Does this mean that every RL technique applied in this setting should fall in some supervised learning category ? How would any RL technique applied to solve a supervised problem compare with a standard supervised framework?


NB: question Can supervised learning be recast as reinforcement learning problem? is very similar and answers point 1, but still left point 2 not very clear to me.

Is it true that a multi-armed-bandit selects an action based on the future reward?,"
During my machine learning lecture I saw the following statement on the slides: ""Multi-armed-bandit selects an action based on the future reward""
Is that statement true?
In my opinion it is false because the selection of the action is not based on the reward directly as it is not known but on some strategy to maximize the reward in the long run.
Could maybe someone provide some references if it true or not, as I could not find any.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'multi-armed-bandits']","If you changed this:""Multi-armed-bandit selects an action based on the future reward""To this""Multi-armed-bandit selects an action based on the expected future reward""The description would be better in my opinion. Perhaps expected is just missing on the slide for brevity. I would rate the original quote as mostly true and give the author the benefit of the doubt here.However, the quote is out of context, and how a multi-armed bandit agent selects an action can be more complex than simply considering the expected future reward. In bandit agents, the agent is usually considered to be learning ""live"", and has to balance exploring for better options versus exploiting a known best option so far. This is commonly referred to as minimising regret - which technically is a measure of how the agent performs in expectation (using actual action choices, but mean rewards for those actions as opposed to observed rewards) against an imaginary version of itself that always chose the best action in hindsight (or by revealing hidden knowledge of true values in the end for test cases).If you include this training behaviour in the description, then you could also say:""Multi-armed-bandit selects an action based on minimising regret""Although this is not technically excluding basing on expected future reward, since usually the estimates of action values are used to make a decision, and ""based on"" is not the same as ""only considering""."
Can you confirm that the transformer works strictly deterministically and there is no randomness inside or between the attention layers?,"
On a high-level temperature and randomness affect the output of a generative language model:

Lower temperature: Produces more focused, conservative, and consistent responses.

Moderate temperature: Strikes a balance between creativity and consistency. This setting can be useful for general content generation, where a blend of accuracy and inventiveness is desired.

Higher temperature: Generates more creative, diverse, and unexpected outputs.


What I'm not sure of is where exactly randomness (controlled by the temperature) comes into play. I believe to have understood that it's only after a transformer has done its deterministic work, suggesting some probable next words.

Your suggested input dataset of text, images, videos about US presidents does not appear to include any poll results that could be learned from.A variation of your dataset might be used to predict poll preferences. If you had some simple summary data about people who have voted in similar polls in the past (e.g. demographics such as age, political party membership, location) and also summarised data about each president (approval ratings, number of terms etc), then you may be able to train a machine learning system to learn a little how personal preferences work in the context of your poll. You could then use it to predict poll results for unseen people, and unseen presidents, provided you have the same summary data for the new people and new presidents.This is quite similar to recommendation systems, so if instead of structured data about people and presidents, you had results of multiple similar polls from multiple people, then you might be able to train a system that predicted outcome of a new poll if you knew what a person chose in one or more previous similar polls.Processing that included unstructured data such as text articles, images and videos is harder, but not impossible. The trick would be to reduce this data down into simpler numerical format - e.g. you could use a language model to extract sentiment (positive or negative articles) from texts. You would still need to have some previous poll results in your training data in order to help predict what these summaries might mean for a new poll.What you should not do is pour lots of unstructured data into some summary machine, and expect it to output anything usefully predictive about a specific function that you want to know about. The chances of the results being correct is no better than you simply guessing at the start."

Positional encoding in transformers,"
After training a single-head transformer, I'm trying to understand some of its internals.
The question I want to answer is:

Given token=X in the last position, how does the query it generates correlates (dot-product) with the keys produced by tokens in other positions?

For example, if I use single letters for the tokens and the token in the last position is a ""H"", it's probably very important for it to know if there's a ""T"" in the previous position (since ""THE"" is a very common word in English) and less important to know if there's a ""T"" 2 positions before it. So calling the query produced by token ""H"" in the last position QHL, I'd expect a softmax of the [(QHL . key(""T"", pos-2)), (QHL . key(""T"", pos-3))] to be something like [0.90, 0.10].
Does that make sense? I hope not (but I don't know why), because this is not working well.
I mean, in a sense this works, but the softmax result is the same regardless of the second token (e.g. it doesn't matter if I dot-product with ""T"" as in the example or with ""H"").
I created a toy example to try to demonstrate this:
# let's encode just 2 tokens and 3 positions using one-hot encoding instead of a trained embedding
tok1 = torch.tensor([1, 0, 0])*1.0  # let's say this is token ""H""
tok2 = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0])*1.0  # let's say this is token ""T""
pos1 = torch.tensor([1, 0, 0])*0.5  # first position
pos2 = torch.tensor([0, 1, 0])*0.5  # second position
pos3 = torch.tensor([0, 0, 1])*0.5  # third/last position

# query(x) and key(x) linear layers
q = nn.Linear(3, 3)
k = nn.Linear(3, 3)

q13 = q(tok1 + pos3)  # query produced by tok1 in pos3
k11 = k(tok1 + pos1)  # key produced by tok1 in pos1
k12 = k(tok1 + pos2)  # key produced by tok1 in pos2
k21 = k(tok2 + pos1)  # key produced by tok2 in pos1
k22 = k(tok2 + pos2)  # key produced by tok2 in pos2

r11 = torch.dot(q13, k11)  # ""affinity"" (dot product) between q13 and k11
r12 = torch.dot(q13, k12)  # ""affinity"" (dot product) between q13 and k12
r21 = torch.dot(q13, k21)  # ""affinity"" (dot product) between q13 and k21
r22 = torch.dot(q13, k22)  # ""affinity"" (dot product) between q13 and k22

print(""query(tok1+pos3) . key(tok1+pos1)="", r11)
print(""query(tok1+pos3) . key(tok1+pos2)="", r12)

print(""query(tok1+pos3) . key(tok2+pos1)="", r21)
print(""query(tok1+pos3) . key(tok2+pos2)="", r22)

print(""sm1="", F.softmax(torch.tensor([r11, r12]), dim=-1))
print(""sm2="", F.softmax(torch.tensor([r21, r22]), dim=-1))

output:
query(tok1+pos3) . key(tok1+pos1)= tensor(-0.5932, grad_fn=<DotBackward0>)
query(tok1+pos3) . key(tok1+pos2)= tensor(-0.3802, grad_fn=<DotBackward0>)
query(tok1+pos3) . key(tok2+pos1)= tensor(-0.1671, grad_fn=<DotBackward0>)

sm1= tensor([0.4469, 0.5531])
sm2= tensor([0.4469, 0.5531])

In the end, the softmax of
[query(tok1+pos3) . key(tok1+pos1), query(tok1+pos3) . key(tok1+pos2)]
is == to the softmax of

About the requirement to compute the gradient at layer $l$,"
I'm trying to understand a line of my note.
Let's say there is a simple feedforward neural network that has $N$ layers, and for a given layer $l$, it has weight $W^l$, and $g^l$ is the gradient to update it. Now the problem is:

From the Wiki page of Backpropagation, to compute $\nabla_{W^l}C$(or simply $g^l$), i.e. the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weight of layer $l$, you will need two things:

A sub-expression $\delta^l$, which is the gradient of the weighted output of the current layer $l$, i.e. $\nabla_{z^l}C$. (there is no such symbol in the link, but I believe my usage is correct.)
The activation of the previous layer $l-1$, i.e. $a^{l-1}$.



This is why it says $\nabla_{W^l}C=\delta^l(a^{l-1})^T$. My reasoning of this is that: the weighted output of layer $l$, i.e. $z^l$, is the result of multiplication between the output of the previous layer, i.e. $a^{l-1}$, and the weight of the current layer, i.e. $W^l$.

But now I found my note saying something different: it says that to compute the gradient $\nabla_{W^l}C$(or simply $g^l$), it would require $W^{l+1},g^{l+1},a^l$,  that is: the weight and gradient of the next layer and the output of the current layer.

Is my note wrong?

To think one step further (not part of the question): Modern teachers might not only tell the student which steps were wrong and right, but also explain why. Shouldn't LLMs be able to understand such explanations (possibly in natural language) to improve their learning?

",['reinforcement-learning'],"In general a stationary distribution is a distribution over something (e.g. actions, states, etc) that doesn't change over time, for example.Example of non-stationary distributions can be easily found in multi-agent RL, when modelling the policy of some other agent: in this case the opponent's policy can be non-stationary since it can adapt itself to the other agents, and so on. In such case, that distribution will change with time, or, better said, with novel gathered experience from the environment and other agents.In you case the distribution $d_\pi(s)$ is stationary over states: giving a fixed policy $\pi$ (that doesn't change), the distribution of states that the policy visits does not change too, e.g. with time. In simpler words, $\pi$ always visits the same states at each rollout. As the next line in the text says ""the stationary distribution varies with the learned policy"", means that if you update $\pi$ then $d_\pi$ will change consequently assigning a diverse probability mass over $s$.I think that $d_\pi$ is also related to the transition dynamics of the environment: maybe the text is implicitly assuming that neither the underlying environment will change with time, so that fixing both the env and policy the visited/reached states and their probability are the same across timesteps/transitions."

How to extract body of a base-model and fine tune with that body on different shape dataset like this situation,"
In BERT like transformer model (I am not talking about BERT in this thread), it has 2 training objectives Masked Language Modeling and Next sentence prediction right? and BERT model is also supports different input shapes, So I am actually building a model with 2 training objectives on a base model and those 2 training objectives are Denoising data on time-series and Triplet loss on time sereis and just want to take the base model body and fine tune the model on different data with different shape in TensorFlow, How is code written for this in tensorflow at low-level and what I mean is extract that body add new inputs and new outputs to this base model and fine-tune whole model on some dataset with different shape.

outputs = layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')(x)


base_model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=x)

Pre-training Base model:
input_denoising = keras.Input(shape=(x_unlabelled.shape[1], x_unlabelled.shape[2]))
x = base_model(input_denoising)
x=layers.Dense(3000*7,activation=tf.nn.leaky_relu)(x)
output_denoising=layers.Reshape((3000, 7))(x)

input_1 = keras.Input(shape=(x_unlabelled.shape[1], x_unlabelled.shape[2]))
input_2 = keras.Input(shape=(x_unlabelled.shape[1], x_unlabelled.shape[2]))
input_3 = keras.Input(shape=(x_unlabelled.shape[1], x_unlabelled.shape[2]))

output_1 = base_model(input_1)
output_2 = base_model(input_2)
output_3 = base_model(input_3)

concatenated = layers.concatenate([output_1, output_2, output_3])
output = layers.Dense(2, activation='softmax')(concatenated)


combined_model=keras.Model(inputs=[input_denoising,input_1, input_2, input_3],outputs=[output_denoising,output])
combined_model.compile(optimizer='adam',loss=['mse','categorical_crossentropy'])

combined_model.summary()

So, now I want to remove all the input and outputs and add new inputs and outputs aligned with new data and fine-tune on that dataset, so how can I do this

NLP - Sentence reconstruction,"
I need to define a neural network for sentence reconstruction. Below the details:
The dataset is composed by a snapshot of wikipedia. We restricted the vocabolary to the 10K most frequent words, and only took sentences making use of this vocabulary. In addition, we restricted to sequences with a length between 3 and 30 words.
Here an example:
For instance, given the sequence of words



to henry at be first france the king wanted with of friends



the model should be able to reconstruct the following sentence



at first henry wanted to be friends with the king of france



Concerning the score:
Let s be the source string and p your prediction. The quality of the results will be measured according to the following metric:
look for the longest substring w between s and p
compute |w|/|s|
If the match is exact, the score is 1.
When computing the score, you should NON consider the start and end tokens.
The longest common substring can be computed with the SequenceMatcher function of difflib, that allows a simple definition of our metric.
The score must be computed as an average of at least 3K random examples taken form the test set.

Trying to understand the definition of environment in this paper on monte carlo approximation of AIXI,"
Here is the link to the paper https://www.davidsilver.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/mc_aixi_long.pdf
Definition 2. An environment $\rho$ is a sequence of conditional probability functions $\{ \rho_0, \rho_1, \rho_2, ...\}$, where $\rho_n: A^n \rightarrow Density(X^n)$ that satisfies
$$ \forall a_{i:n} \forall x_{<n} : \rho_{n-1}(x_{<n}|a_{<n}) = \sum_{x_n \in X} \rho_n (x_{1:n} | a_{1:n})$$
In the base case, we have $\rho_0(\epsilon | \epsilon) = 1$
Ok so the right hand side seems to be saying, that $x_{1:n}$ will be made from $x_{<n}$ concatenated with $x_n \in X$, and the sum will be over these different realizations of $x_{1:n}$, so the probability function for the shorter sequence $\rho_{n-1}(x_{<n} | a_{<n})$ depends on the possible longer sequences? This seems to be what the equation is saying but it doesn't make sense that the present probability of a sequence depends on possible future outcomes.

Translating relatively little known language,"
I want to build a model that does translation from some little known foreign language to English. No clue how to go about and wanted to get some advice.
Here’s what I have:
An old pdf (looks like something that was just scanned into a pdf so it’s kinda difficult) that has a word in the foreign language and Spanish and English translations
I estimated that it’s only about 3500-4000 words (a small dictionary)
My hope is to try to use a voice to text app to capture a speaker’s voice(speaking foreign language) and turn it into text. And then use the dictionary to make approximative translations and output that into a screen.
Basically,
Real-time translating apps use a combination of machine learning and artificial intelligence to translate text or speech from one language to another. The process typically works as follows:
1.The user speaks or types in a sentence or phrase in the source language.
2.The app uses a microphone or speech-to-text engine to convert the input to text.
3.The app uses a machine learning model to translate the text into the target language.
4. The translated text is displayed on the screen or if one wants to be ambitious spoken aloud by the app.
Seems simple but I feel like I would need to work on obtaining more data. Perhaps approaching hundreds of people or work with a team to somehow and more words and many sentence combinations?
What exactly would I need to do? and how realistic is it? Hoping to use ChatGPT4(haven't used it) or other LLMs

Node classification with random labels for GNNs,"
I decided to train GCN on the Cora dataset for the node classification task, however, with the random labels, i.e., applying np.random.shuffle(labels). For the default set of parameters, I am getting an accuracy of around 0.3 for the test set and 0.4 for the train set. I expect that for the random labels, the accuracy would be 1/number of classes. So in the case of Cora: 1/7 = 0.14.
Do you have any intuition why graph neural networks perform better than the random case? I am aware that in [1] authors trained the models on the random labels and achieved perfect results on the train set. However, for test size they still were around the 1/number of classes.
I checked simpler models such as RandomForests or SVC and the final accuracy for the test size is indeed 1/7.

If your network always predicts the label 0, then its accuracy should be $\frac{818}{2708} \approx 0.38$. Which roughly matches your number, probably this is the reason why the accuracy is not $\frac{1}{7}$."

Monte Carlo Tree Search for Robo Rally AI,"
I want to implement an AI capable of playing the game RoboRally (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RoboRally) using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). In RoboRally, there are 2-8 characters controlled by (human) players, each of which must reach checkpoints. However, each turn, a character can only move by playing cards chosen by the player associated with that character. For example, the card MOVE2 allows a character to move 2 tiles in the direction they are facing on the gameboard.
In each turn, the player selects 5 cards from their hand of 9 cards, which are then played in the chosen order. Each node in the MCTS represents a game state with a certain set of chosen cards. For example, a node expanded from the root might represent playing the MOVE2 card first for a player. My question is: how should I simulate a game state to a terminal state in this case? As I understand it, a terminal state would be reached when 5 cards are chosen, i.e., the fifth level of the MCTS is reached.
Considering the example where only MOVE2 is chosen first, should the simulation involve randomly choosing the remaining 4 cards from my hand of 9 cards and then simulate the game state with these chosen cards? This evalution might then be how far the character is from the next checkpoint. The closer the character is to the next checkpoint, the better the evaluation, i.e., value of the node. Furthermore, is MCTS even a suitable choice for this game, considering that reaching a terminal state does not evaluate to a win/loss/draw situation, and I must evaluate the simulations with a function, which might be very complicated.
If MCTS is not suitable, what other algorithms would be appropriate for implementing an AI for this kind of game?
I would appreciate any advice and feedback!

Is orthogonal initialization still useful when hidden layer sizes vary?,"
Pytorch's orthogonal initialization cites ""Exact solutions to the nonlinear dynamics of learning in deep linear neural networks

However, I can empirically see that if I use this initialization method for hidden layers that have a higher number of neurons than the input and output, then isometry goes away. E.g.
import torch, numpy
def g(r,c):
    w = torch.empty(r, c)

How do I set up the training data and how do I go about solving this using Bert? My best solution was information extraction or a combined approach of intent classification and NER, where intent can be classified based on fixed labels- to seek collaboration/ seek advice. Etc.

cross_val_score of sklearn and LinearRegression scoring method,"
cross_val_score (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.cross_val_score.html) uses the estimator’s default scorer (if available) and LinearRgression (the estimator I use - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html) uses The coefficient of determination (which  is defined as $R^2 = 1 - \frac{u}{v}$, where
$u$ is the residual sum of squares ((y_true - y_pred)** 2).sum() and
$v$ is the total sum of squares ((y_true - y_true.mean()) ** 2).sum().
The best possible score is 1.0 and it can be negative (because the model can be arbitrarily worse). A constant model that always predicts the expected value of y, disregarding the input features, would get a score of 0.0.)
Is y_true.mean the y_true.mean of the training set or the testing set? If it's the one of the testing set, isn't it ""cheating"" i.e. we compare our predictions to a method that has inferred something from the testing set?
So doing better than a baseline wouldn't be having $R^2 > 0$ but rather $R^2 > -0.01$ or something like this?

In slide 27/66, it states that ""This is the maximum value achievable under any policy"". My understanding of Value-based RL is that the optimal Q-table/function will be learnt. Afterwards, the implicit optimal policy can be ""derived"" by greedily picking the actions based on this learnt Q-value.
Does the implicit policy not matter here?
",['reinforcement-learning'],"This is the maximum value achievable under any policyThe statement says that $Q^*(s,a)$ is the maximum possible state-action value that is achievable (at most) by any policy, $\pi$: including the random policy, and the optimal policy. It is also explained in slide 23:Indeed, the optimal policy $\pi^*$ would always achieve $Q^*$. It does not mean that the implicit policy (the one that can be derived from it: $\pi^*(s)=\arg\max_aQ^*(s,a)$) is not important, neither that it cannot be computed from $Q^*$.You have to think about this in terms of policy evaluation (or prediction, in classical RL terminology): you have the optimal action-value table, that you can use to compute the value (or return) that some policy achieves, as well as to derive the optimal policy by taking the action that maximizes $Q^*$ for a given state."

Are there existing approaches to train AI for consciousness,"
I am somewhat of an amateur to this topic so I just want to put forward an idea and I would be happy to be educated what the current state of the art in that direction is.
One of the big questions is how to get an AI that is conscious. It seems to me the surest way to get that would be to train for it, rather then let it emerge by chance. To do that I would imagine to use problems that need one or more properties associated with a ""self"" to solve it.
E.g. catching a ball that was thrown. To do that the self needs to know its position in space relative to the ball thrown. Maybe an intermediate layer could be trained for the current position, while the output could be trained for the velocity and direction to go to catch the ball. This should help to establish the concept of ones own position in space for the AI. Of course there should be many different problems that help solidify the same property.
Many different properties that can be associated with a self should be trained for. The nodes that correspond to those properties should probably be closely connected, to establish some kind of self core where that information is compressed into.
One could start with problems that require one dimension of the self core to solve, respectively. Then move on to problems that require multiple ones. I suspect the higher the number of dimensions of the ""self core"" the closer it would get to a state we would recognize as consciousness.
My question would be, whether some kind of approach like that was ever investigated? Or alternatively, why this approach would not be feasable or would not work?

Neural translation model - alignment as a latent variable or as a trainable part of the model,"
I consider the neural machine translation method in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.0473.pdf.
I understand that the intuition here, as the title says, is to jointly train alignment and translation. Alignment is part of the model, the alignment model is
$ e_{ij} = a(s_{i-1}, h_{j}) $
where function $a$ scores the match between information around time j represented by an annotation $h_{j}$ and the translation model output at time $i-1$ represented by the RNN's hidden state $s_{i-1}$.
I kind of understand we obtain a big model intricating the alignment part embedded by the annotations and the translation part, in particular with annotations depending on the hidden states of the translation model.
It says,
Note that unlike in traditional machine translation, 
the alignment is not considered to be a latent variable.

Here my question, how is a model like, which considers alignment as a latent variable?
It might be similar to the approach described in this article, with the ""alignment model"" made ""not trainable"". In this case, how is alignment computed? How would one formalize this translation model where alignment is a latent variable?

Or do they use scaled-down CNN models or GAN that can run on the phone's processor? If so, are there lightweight models or algorithms that can run on the desktop PC's CPU or integrated GPU (APU)?
","['convolutional-neural-networks', 'generative-adversarial-networks', 'filters', 'face-detection', 'deep-face']","Face filters works by first detecting and localizing the face, then predicting the so called facial landmarks (a set of points that depict the geometry of the face, like its contour, shape of eyes, nose, mouth, ecc), and lastly applying the filter potentially yield by some generative model.These are all heavy work. For example, you can have a pipeline that first detects a face, if no faces you stop the processing. Otherwise you can have a multi-task model that yields the face bounding-box and landmarks directly, so improving the runtime because you reuse most of the model for both predictions. However, the part related for the filters is probably always separated, moreover you have to deal with computer graphics to render the filter and also apply some nice FX.What I want to say is that both solutions are possible, and even a combination of them.If you plan to implement something similar on your on PC, you can use OpenCV (either with Python or C++) for, e.g., tracking, then compress a DL model with tf-lite in case you use tensorflow and/or Keras: you can take a pre-trained model, and compress with such tool. In that way, you can target optimized CPU and GPU models. For the graphics part you should find some optimized library for GPU, or write the code yourself like in OpenGL or similar.

These two lines should be iterated for the sequence length $T$, so you get as output hidden states $h=(h_1,...,h_T)$ and sequences $y=(y_1,...,y_T)$. $\mathcal{H}$ is the activation function.According to the paper:Deep RNNs can be created by stacking multiple RNN hidden layers on top of each other, with the output sequence of one layer forming the input sequence for the
next.This means that the recurrence is at the level of computing the hidden state, $h_t$, meaning that if you have $N$ recurrent layers you compute all the $h^n$ sequences iteratively, and then when at the end you compute the output sequence $y$ which is also the network's output. See Eq. 11 and 12.In general, I've seen that RNNs have different implementations. For example, in Keras the recurrence occurs on the output sequence $y$: so you compute all the output sequences, and optionally also return the states (if so these will inizialize the states of the next layer), which are fed to the next recurrent layer."
Improving embedding similarity search of aggregated embeddings,"
I am building an author suggestion tool that proposes authors writing about similar topics as a given input text. I want to use embeddings for this. The way I currently do it is to store embeddings of many articles of many different authors in a vector database. Then I generate an embedding for every author by taking the embeddings of their last X articles and calculate the mean of those vectors. I can then compare the embedding of any given input text with the aggregated author embeddings using cosine similarity.
This does work to some extend but it looks like:

The aggregated author embeddings do not only capture topics, but also other things such as writing style, language, and so on. Which I am not really intested in.
By using a mean as embedding it captures the broad field of an author quite well (e.g. tech, science, economy, sports) but the sub-fields seem to get over-shadowed by authors that write more generic articles sometimes. Searching for a niche topic often doesn't give the best results as the niche authors that wrote articles about it often get scored worse than authors that write more generic articles in the same overacrching field.

I am looking for ways to improve my method, any suggestions are welcome.

How do I choose a good treshold for classification (using cosine similarity scores)?,"
I am using openai's text-embedding-ada-002 embeddings model to do a semantic search on a database of articles to find articles that are most related to a given input text. I am looking for a way to define a minimum similarity score to prevent returning articles that aren't actually related enough.
There is two difficulties that I have:

For some search queries a certain similarity score seems appropriate as a minimum treshold value, but then for others that minimum value seems to be too strict. For instance I find that for very well defined specific topics you generally want a higher treshold similarity score than for more broad or generic texts. That's my intuition so far at least.
The scores of the openai embedding model almost always fall between 0.77 and 1 instead of using the entire range of -1 to 1 and in reality the scores in normal cases all fall around 0.88. Having all scores so close to eachother makes it harder to pinpoint a good treshold value.

Since $\bar\alpha_{t}$ is known, and if we have $x_{t}$, we use trained model to predict $\epsilon$, then why can't we get $x_{0}$ directly by using this equation?

"How is a parameter explosion prevented, when connecting a mutlihead attention layer with the dense layers in LLMs (speciafially, LLama)?","
I have had a look at LLamas model card, specifically the 7B parameter version:
https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/MODEL_CARD.md
which I assume is an encoder only transformer similar to this:

But then I did some math.If the dimension of every Dense layer, including the one connecting to the Attention layer is 4096, the context length is 2048, the number of attention heads is 32 and the embedding size is 786, then the output size of the attention layer is 32 * 786 * 2048 and as such the number of weights to connect it to the dense layer is 32 * 766 * 2048 * 4096, which is 205B parameters, which is obviously far more than 7B. So how is this accomplished? How big is the ouput of the attention layer and how is it connected to the following Dense layers?
","['attention', 'large-language-models']","Let's start over and count the number of parameters, looking at the code in the same repository:The Attention layer is defined here in llama/model.py, it defines four matrices wq, wk, wv and wo. Each matrix is dim $\times$ n_heads * head_dim. And head_dim is computed as head_dim = dim // n_heads.The FeedForward bit is defined here in llama/model.py, it defines three matrices  w1, w2, w3.  Each matrix is dim $\times$ hidden_dim. And hidden_dim is computed as:Now, dim is the embedding dimension - for 7B model it is 4096 (not 786).
Number of heads n_heads is 32.
And multiple_of is some kind of align-to-power-of-2 factor, equals to 256.Gathering the whole thing:I'm getting total_weights = 6 476 005 376.There are also input and output embeddings that add 2 * vocab_size * dim getting me to 6.9 billon for vocab_size = 50000.Note that max context size does not enter the computation at all.I'll leave computing the number of weights for larger models as an exercise."
What is MLM & NSP loss function,"
Two objective functions are used during the BERT language
model pretraining step.
The first one is masked language
model (MLM) that randomly masks
15% of the

The second objective
is the next sentence prediction (NSP) task. This is a binary
classification task for predicting whether two sentences are
subsequent in the original text.
I am looking for such objective function as mathematical definition.

Can a reward function have various cases?,"
I'm doing a Q-learning algorithm and I'm designing my reward function. Basically I'm working on optimizing a network while changing some parameters. My metric to measure its optimization is the delay on a flow of data (generated).
I've discretized my delay values in intervals and now I'm designing the rewards. What I was thinking about is, as I want to prioritize lower delays to use a non linear function such as $1/x^2$.
The range of my delays are usually from $10$ to $40$ secs (depending on the perturbations). It works well when the delay is varying a lot, but way less good when the delay isn't varying that much (with low perturbations).
I was then wondering if there are restrictions on reward functions. What I wanted to do is to have different parts depending on the value. Like if my value is in an interval under $15$ secs can I normalize the value? And use another way to calculate reward when it's in an interval above?
I'm new to reinforcement learning so maybe what I said is non sense, but I would gladly hear any advice or idea.

","['reinforcement-learning', 'machine-learning', 'reward-functions']","In general the reward function can be anything that allows you to solve the task: if the reward is misspecified, the env cannot be solved; this is the reward hypothesis which RL relies on.So, consider the reward function to be defined as $r(s,a)$ or even $r(s,a,s')$ from a state $s$, actions $a$, and sometimes including also the next state $s'$. It can be as much complex as you want, having various cases, parts, and so on. But consider that if too complex you may find a hard time debugging it, to see if the reward fn suits your task. Also, different rewards (assuming they are correct enabling to solve the problem) may result in slower or faster convergence to optimality.What I wanted to do is to have different parts depending on the value. Like if my value is in an interval under 15

Try to have a reward range that is bounded and possibly limited (e.g. $[-1, 1]$), avoiding large values and occasional spikes.For example, you mentioned that $1/x^2$ works well when the delays are quite different. In the case the delays are similar, you can try to transform them (e.g. by $\exp$ to increase the difference) and then apply the above function. For example, case 1 is $1/x^2$, case 2 can be $1/\exp(x)$, case 3 something else, etc.."
Spiking neural network framework for training simple networks with no biases and negative weights,"
I'm looking for a spiking neural network framework to train (at the beginning) a simple network with two or so hidden layers against MNIST digits dataset, and then to take the weights and try to model it as an electrical circuit. That's why I'm looking for a framework that could best describe physical LIF nodes and connections.
An example model of physical LIF (obviously the framework doesn't have to implement this exactly) modeled by differential equation taken from S. R. Nandakumar, et al. (2020). Here $C_m$ is the membrane capacitance, $g_L$ is the leak conductance, $E_L$ is the leak reversal potential, and $I(t)$ is the
net synaptic current fowing into the neuron.
$$C_m\frac{dV(t)}{dt}=-g_l(V(t) - E_L) + I(t) $$
I tried to use NengoDL, but the neurons there have biases (which aren't present in physical description of LIF neurons, and I haven't found a way to disable them), and it would be great if you could restrict the weights to only positive values (as far as I know you can't do this in Nengo).

Similarly in the region where $x>y$ we have $f(x,y)=x$ which is also differentiable.However on the line where $x=y$ this function is continuous but not differentiable. To see this consider for example $max(t, 1-t)$ for a real value $t$. This is continuous but has a kink at $t=1/2$ so is not differentiable at this point. This is exactly where it crosses the $x=y$ line."
Why use ReLU over Leaky ReLU?,"
From my understanding a leaky ReLU attempts to address issues of vanishing gradients and nonzero-centeredness by keeping neurons that fire with a negative value alive.
With just this info to go off of, it would seem that the leaky ReLU is just an overall improvement to the standard ReLU, yet ReLU still seems to be the gold standard of activation functions. Why is that?
Does the additional sparsity outweigh the value gained from negative local gradients? If so, is tanh just too sparse?
","['machine-learning', 'deep-learning', 'backpropagation', 'gradient-descent', 'activation-functions']","Your understanding or Leaky ReLU is correct, and, yes, it has been proposed to mitigate the dying neurons issue in ReLU: when these are negative, they got zeroed.Regarding the answer of @Regresslt:Does the additional sparsity outweigh the value gained from negative local gradients?That's an interesting. I mean the dying ReLU phenomenon is usually observed on a fraction of the units, not the totality. In my personal experience I've noticed (dense) layers with ReLU to be sparse as much as $50$ to $90\%$. In general this causes an under utilization of the capacity of the model, which may lead to under-fitting. But from another perspective can be seen as implicit $l_1$-regularization applied on each layer with ReLU, that is optimized along the model which may lead to better generalization performance: simply because the model learned to achieve the right capacity by itself. Also, if such large sparsity is achieved the use of Dropout on top can be totally non-beneficial, because it would drop also the remaining ""active"" units/neurons.Is tanh just too sparse?First, $\tanh$ is not sparse since the output values can be either $-1$ or $1$ when saturation is reached, which is its main issue that shares with sigmoid (that instead can lead to sparsity.)  When tanh or sigmoid saturate you get vanishing gradients, and the training stops. Instead, the sparsity induced by ReLU does not reduce the gradient, since it will only be multiplied by some zero elements (corresponding to the died units.): the gradient magnitude depends on the overall output of the layer. In practice (but I'd say it's hard to happen), only if all units of all layers are died your network won't learn anymore, and the gradient would vanish because each layers would only output zeroes.To conclude, ReLU is usually the first activation to try - it seems to always work sufficiently well - but remember also to pair the activation fn with the right choice of weight initialization, in order to prevent issues (dying units, saturation, etc), speed-up convergence, and even increase performance."

How to interpret the policy notation $\pi_{\theta}(a_{t}|s_{t})$ in Reinforcement Learning?,"
In the context of Reinforcement Learning, I have seen that the policy $\pi$ (for some algorithms) is nothing but a Neural Network architecture (for example a Feedforward Neural Network).
This policy is usually annotated as $\pi_{\theta}$, suggesting the policy is parameterized by $\theta$.
Question 1: Does this mean that $\theta$ in this case would represent all the Neural Network's parameters?

Combine multiple losses with gradient descent,"

I am thinking of better approaches. My current idea is to clip gradients separately (to avoid having one gradient ""overtaking"" the others too much), then weigh them, sum them, and finally clip them (with a smaller threshold than the one used for the first clipping).
Something like: $clip(w_1clip(\nabla_{L_1},c) + w_2clip(\nabla_{L_2},c) + w_3clip(\nabla_{L_3},c), c_2)$.

"Why does ChatGPT fail in playing ""20 questions""?","
IBM Watson's success in playing ""Jeopardy!"" was a landmark in the history of artificial intelligence. In the seemingly simpler game of ""Twenty questions"" where player B has to guess a word that player A thinks of by asking questions to be answered by ""Yes/No/Hm"" ChatGPT fails epically - at least in my personal opinion. I thought first of Chartres cathedral and it took ChatGPT 41 questions to get it (with some additional help), and then of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason where after question #30 I had to explicitly tell ChatGPT that it's a book. Then it took ten further questions. (Chat protocols can be provided. It may be seen that ChatGPT follows no or bad question policies or heuristics humans intuitively would use.)
My questions are:

Is there an intuitive understanding why ChatGPT plays ""20 questions"" so bad?

And why do even average humans play it so much better?

Might it be a future emergent ability which may possibly arise in ever larger LLMs?

"What is the difference between ""Image Clustering"" and ""Unsupervised Classification"" tasks?","
I am trying to compare some results that I obtained in benchmarks with my unsupervised model. My model basically takes an unlabelled dataset and clusters it into semantic classes (10 clusters in the case of MNIST). However this clustering is done in such a way that a classifier is created (unsupervisedly), as for every image, it outputs a $k$-long vector, with probabilities of being in cluster number $k$.
For evaluation, and because I actually have the labels of the dataset (only to evaluate), I associate every cluster with a class (based on the most assignments to a class per cluster), and calculate an accuracy.
When trying to compare with the MNIST benchmark for instance, I found these two very confusing categories:
On the one hand, we have Unsupervised Image Classification on MNIST
https://paperswithcode.com/sota/unsupervised-image-classification-on-mnist
On the other hand, we have Image Clustering on MNIST-full
https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-clustering-on-mnist-full
They record different scores, as if some papers don't qualify for one task but do for the other. At the same time, some papers are in both categories.
What's the difference? I'd really like to know because I'm obtaining State of the Art in this benchmark, and I need to be sure that I'm comparing against the correct papers.
edit: another thing I noticed is that some papers that do classification by clustering images, don't use a test dataset. Why is this allowed? How can they know that the generalization ability of their model is still good?

TD Leaf value function update,"
I'm currently watching a RL course by David Silver and he explains the update of TD Leaf, here is the slide:

He says that if, at the next turn (after we played red and the opponent played blue) instead of the blue node the opponent played node number 1 (because the next minimax search indicated we were wrong at state St because we did not look ""far enough""), we then pick the one in the bottom right corner for example (node number 4), we still update the blue node value on the left diagram and not the node next to the blue node (node number 1).
The explanation follows a question from a student and is at this timestep:
https://youtu.be/kZ_AUmFcZtk?t=4346
I'm struggling to understand why we wouldn't update the value of the node next to the blue one (node number 1), since that's the action that ended up being selected.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'temporal-difference-methods']","In temporal difference learning, we do not wait to collect the full trajectory before performing backups. That means at the time of performing the backup, we may be ""wrong"". In fact that is the most common situation for all initial backups (ours and our opponent's).On the next pass through however, the successor states will have also been updated by the opponent's choice. So we may correctly predict their decision, and get a more accurate backup. That is, providing they were correct in their decision. The opponent could be facing a very similar situation. We don't actually know that the later state information they worked from is a better prediction of who will win - it is more likely to be in general, as winner data backs up from game end states - but it is not guaranteed.Using a longer ""real"" trajectory to decide what to backup doesn't fix things - although it may capture actual results, those rely on too many interim poorly-informed choices (unless you have capacity to perform a full tree search), so there is a lot of variance, whlst TD learning swaps that variance for bias. Both the bias (in TD learning) and variance (in e.g. Monte Carlo learning) reduce over time as more data is collected. In practice TD learning often performs better - although for game playing that may depend a lot on the type of game."
Training model for a board game with large actions space,"
that has a NxM board, and players take turns putting their ""dots"" on the board a X,Y coordinate, taking up the space. When a few connected dots surround an opponent dot(s), the surrounding dots create a polygon which is taken (no dots can be put on it) and counting the surrounded dots as points. The game ends when less than 20% of the board remains available and the winner is the player who has more points.

So my question is, how do I approach the training of an agent for this game? I've trained a model on a much simpler ""fighting"" game, with 3 possible actions, stamina and HP to acceptable results using this setup:
# Define the game environment
NUM_OF_ACTIONS = 3
NUM_OF_EPISODES = 20

# Define the neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(NUM_OF_ACTIONS, activation='softmax')
])

# Define the loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.SparseCategoricalCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001)

And this code for training each step:
action_probs = model.predict(np.array([state]))
        action = np.random.choice(NUM_OF_ACTIONS, p=action_probs[0])

        # Take the chosen action and observe the resulting state and reward
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)
        print(f""{reward=}, {done=}"")
        # Train the model on the observed transition
        train_step(state, action, reward, next_state, done)


But in setup I don't see a way to limit the action space when coordinates become unavailable - how do I disable coords as they become unavailable?

Do I need to train the agent to play on each map size (NxM) I want him to play on?

I'm trying to work through a project where I'm writing my own RNN in C++ - not using any libraries. Basically I have an Input layer - 2 hidden layers - and then an output layer. In a given layer, each node collects inputs from EVERY node in the previous layer and then adding a bias, which is normal - like a normal Feed-Forward network.
But here is my question - for the Recurrence, in addition to inputs from previous layer, does a node:

ONLY get feedback from itself
get feedback from every node in its own layer (this is what I'm currently doing - but it may be overkill)
or can a node get feedback from nodes in layers AFTER it - I've seen architecture diagrams that suggest this.

I'm thinking the first one is the way to go - the second one is what I'm current trying on a number of applications and very simple models just never seem to converge. I imaging the 3rd one, would be even more difficult to train.
OR are all 3 correct - they are just different types of RNNs?
Also, I'm assuming that nodes in the OUTPUT layer do not feedback to themselves - those nodes still do activation and have an array of weights and a bias, but they ONLY collect inputs from the last hidden layer - is that correct?

So far, I am making use of cosine similarity, but I found that the training gets slowed down by several orders of magnitude because of that. Each batch, I compute batch_size^2 similarities of vectors with 9000 entries containing non-sparse floating-point numbers. Is there an alternative metric to cosine similarity that is much faster but also differentiable?
","['optimization', 'cosine-similarity']","You probably are not going to get much faster than cosine similarity, the main reason why your calculations are slow is the fact that you execute your operation batch_size$^2$ times which results in a runtime complexity of $O(N^2)$ no matter which metric you choose. However, just to test how much of an improvement you will get by a simpler metric, you might just try the $\infty$-norm: $d(u, v) = \max_i | u_i - v_i |$ or the dot product (i.e. cosine similarity without normalizing the vectors). Just to see whether a simpler metric will actually provide you significant performance improvements.If you then find out that its not the metric, you can check out Linformer by Wang et al.. As you might know the Transformer architecture also compares N vectors pairwisely. Wang et al. deviced a method how to get memory and time complexity from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$.

Nearest neighbour search in high dimension retrieves certain points too often,"
We represent some catalogue items (documents, music tracks, videos, whatever) as vectors embedded in R^d and use them to retrieve nearest neighbours to users query. The typical scenario is that users can input any query and the search results are from a fixed user-catalogue.
I noticed experimentally that certain results occur much more frequent among k-nearest neighbours than other results. The majority of documents is never found among nearest neighbours of any other document from the catalogue, while a few are found many times. In other words, the distribution of ""how many times a document can be found"" is extremely skewed.
It doesn't matter if I use euclidean or cosine similarity or dot product, and it doesn't depend on the catalogue. It seems to depend on the embedding dimension, however.
I tried to reproduce the problem with random data embedded in R^d for various d, and measure the distribution of ""how many times a vector is among 10 nearest neighbours of some other point"". For low dimensions (up to 10) the distribution is close to normal centered at 10. However, with increasing dimension it's getting very skewed. Hubs (points that occur often in k-NN search) are always those points that are nearer to cluster center.
I asked about this on math stackexchange without any response there. The only comments I got there was ""nearest neighbors do not make sense in high dimension, everything is too far from anything else"" which is true but not useful.
I found this paper which recommends (in Chapter 5) to mitigate this problem so that any data point that is a hub (occurs often among k-nearest neighbour search) should be punished, in a similarity search, by some discount. This may work, but looks more like a hack than a systematic approach.
So here is my question:

is there some standard method how to aproach it? Maybe try to minimize the embedding dimension, assuming some other metrics are good enough?
are there some other common practices to ensure that customers don't always get the same (even though good) results?

I'm interested in the topic of Explainability for LLM: the attempts to find some higher understandable structures inside the LLMs or, to put it simply (though may be not completely correctly), the attempts to understand how LLMs ""think"".
Would anybody please recommend where to start?
I'm both interested in foundational papers at this topic and in important latest research.
The great survey or a curated list of papers would be wonderful, although I'm not sure they exist give the speed the field is moving with.
Thank you so much.

"What would the receptive field of a neuron with a 2x2 max pool, stride of 3?","
Bit confused about the concept of a receptive field. I understand it to be the size of the region which influences the output of the neuron of interest. If I have an input of 16x16, and immediately pool afterwards (for simplicity) with a 2x2 window and a stride of 3, does the receptive field of an output neuron end up being 3x3? Or does it remain 2x2, since we do not draw upon any useful info with the gaps between the windows?
",['convolutional-neural-networks'],"The receptive field of a neuron at a given depth (layer) is the number of input pixels that affect its output.For example if you apply a $K\times K$ kernel at each layer, the receptive field of an element in the $L$-th activation would have a size of
$$(1 + L(K-1))\times (1+L(K-1))$$
Now if you introduce a stride $S$ each time, the size of the receptive field is approximately divided by $S$ (you need to take into account padding, and rounding...)In your specific example, you have a $2\times 2$ kernel (it doesn't matter whether the layer is a pooling or a conv) with $S=3$ as stride. This means that you discard $5$ pixels at each slide of the kernel: basically you have $3\times 3=9$ pixels each time but just consider $2\times 2=4$ of them, so five got lost.So, at the input level, the receptive field of the pooling will still be $2\times 2$ but the large stride would have the effect of reducing the receptive field of the next layer(s)."

SHORT VERSION:
""I've got a bunch of GPU mining rigs, surely I can do something useful with them like train my own AI or provide hashing power to astronomy or genome folding operations?""
TLDR:
Having acquired a large collection of GPUs that were previously mining ETH and ETC, as well as a nice stack of opterons with server RAM that were mining Monero I now find myself with a pretty big stack of silicon that isn't being used.
The GPUs seem to me to provide excellent support for graphics algorithms and the opterons I believe might be viable for CPU intensive tasks.
simply put: ""I had a good run mining crypto"", but I didn't sell my hardware...
in this nearly decade long process I learned quite a bit about Linux (since that's what every rig is running on)
My setup was pretty straightforward, I just used Ubuntu and manually installed each mining app, and then manually tuned each GPU. I simply started off with an eclectic mix of mining software, and eventually I pointed everything at NiceHash
once you tap into a serious silicon collection the tendency is to push it as far as you possibly can (it inevitably took over my entire garage)
that served me quite well until 2021. of course 2022 was rough, and in January of 2023 I have shut down the whole operation. (it's just not profitable to mine on GPUs, ETC and ETH aren't viable choices anymore. half of my setup is 4GB cards so those stopped being useful years ago, but I do still have 8 GB and a couple 12 GB cards)
I have a healthy background in full stack development (JavaScript, PHP, SQL). remoting into the machines constantly to babysit them for a decade gave me a healthy crash course in command line
at this point I'm very good at stripping down the hardware and giving ""GPU baths"" to the gear, rebuilding it, flashing the cards, cloning Linux drives, setting up auto run scripts,  replacing fans, ect.
I sold off my ASICs, (let me know if that was a mistake, but I don't see how antminer s9s are anything more than paper weights at this point)
I suspect there's probably a pretty large segment of the mining community (just like me) that is just sitting on a ton of silicon that could be put to better use...
I don't know a whole lot about algorithms but I suspect GPUs are a good choice for training AI? (correct me if I'm wrong about that)
I'm also open to getting different GPUs, maybe a stack of Teslas? (those were horrible for mining, but I see them flooding into eBay on the cheap)
I'm thinking ""gee, maybe I'd like to have my own AI? or perhaps these could be put to good use genome folding?""
at this point I've consumed a ton of information from Google (countless bookmarks closely related to the question I'm asking here)
but I find myself overwhelmed with the information, can anyone help me with the following questions:
first consider this eclectic mix of hardware: Nvidia GPUs, AMD GPUs (with DDR4 RAM) 4GB, 8GB and 12GB cards, couple Ryzen thread rippers, Ryzen 3800s, 3950s, a couple dual CPU Epyc's and a range of old Opteron processors (with ECC server ram), all of which were previously modded to maximize hash rates for cryptocurrency mining.
The CPU rigs were devoted to Monero, GPUs of course were various altcoins, ETH and ETC

1: can I stick with Linux and train an AI?

2: if so, what would be a good AI platform to start with?


I would be interested in training my own generative art AI or simply crunching data. I am not so much interested in language models (I don't want a chatGPT)
I'm not too concerned about the electricity cost, I have an excellent network and the correct electrical infrastructure. (it's not on an industrial scale, but it is a reasonably serious 'hobbyist' home mining operation)
I feel it's also critically important to point out that I've donated hash power to Folding@Home, and I thought that was a very interesting experience.
I'm also open to gearing these rigs to do genome folding (but I'm not sure where to start)
I'm very interested in training an AI for pattern recognition and image recognition. for example, feeding the AI 10,000 images and having it correctly identify patterns or similarities in those images.
if you were to give a checklist of suggestions to get started in training an AI (in my garage on old mining equipment) what would you suggest?
if this is an illogical pipe dream feel free to point out why (I've considered it might be better to just sell the hardware)
if I were to simplify this into an elevator pitch it would simply be: ""I've got a colossal amount of mining equipment that's doing nothing, I think I could put it to good use in the AI sector what would you suggest if I wanted to train my own AI puppy?""
essentially I'm hoping for a series of links and a sobering reality check on electricity cost or hashpower (is it even feasible)
turning a profit is only of minor importance to me, I am more interested in the exploration and the experience of training an open source AI from the ground up.

I don't want a botnet and have no interest in any social media AI related shenanigans
I do think it would be nice if I could just point these rigs at an AI platform (maybe something in astronomy or genetics) and have them turn a small profit on electricity costs, or even just the opportunity to donate the hash power and contribute something meaningful with my 'seemingly' worthless silicon stack
I'm moderately interested in training the AI on stock market data (but I think this is a bit of a fantasy, but one I'm honest about)
I'm extremely interested in training the AI on pattern recognition and generative art
video rendering and 3D render farm opportunities are also of moderate interest (especially if AI is involved)
I would be very interested to see if it's possible to train my own AI to defend websites against bot spam, click fraud and RPA attacks (several of my web clients have indeed been attacked by bad actors using AI and RPA in SEM click fraud attacks)

side note: if you want to provide me with your own ""TLDR"", I want to point out I will be totally happy to read your entire dissertation. (I don't believe in TLDR because TLDR should be based on character limit)
","['ai-design', 'open-ai']","The answer is ""it depends, but generally no"".See, AI operations is all about memory. That is useless for GPU mining. GPU mining cards are generally cost/performance optimized and that leads not to the top end with a lot of RAM, which makes them seriously suboptimal for anything other than the smallest models.On top, TRAINING AI is a LOT more computational intensive than running it - hence companies sing thousands of GPU for the training part."

Tips for getting LSTM to train for next word predcition,"
I am trying to train an LSTM network for next work prediction. I have scraped a rather large dataset from Wikipedia of country descriptions. I have done normal preprocessing (removing punctuation and contractions, etc.). The text is vectorized into integers with a vocab size of 1,000 and any words not in the most common 1,000 are replaced with <unk>. It is then batched into sequences of 128 words each and these are further split to provide variable sequence lengths to the model. In total, I end up with 2.1million sequences, obviously with considerable overlap.
An example of my data (prior to tokenization) is below:
['some', 'scholars', 'suggest', 'that'] -> 'the'
['some', 'scholars', 'suggest', 'that', 'the'] -> 'root'
['some', 'scholars', 'suggest', 'that', 'the', 'root'] -> 'name'
...

It is worth noting that the dataset contains many unknown words (about 30% of the total dataset is <unk>).
The model I am using is a simple LSTM:
from tensorflow.keras import layers, Model
class LSTMModel(Model):
    """"""A super simple LSTM model for history text generation""""""
    def __init__(self, vocab_size, embedding_dim=256, lstm_units=512, num_layers=2,
                 bidirectional=False, num_dense_layers=2, hidden_dim=256, 
                 **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        
        # Embedding from vocab into embedding dimension
        self.embed = layers.Embedding(vocab_size + 1, embedding_dim)
        
        # LSTM layers
        lstm_layers = []
        for _ in range(num_layers - 1):
            local_layer = layers.LSTM(lstm_units, return_sequences=True)
            if bidirectional:
                local_layer = layers.Bidirectional(local_layer)
            lstm_layers.append(local_layer)
            
        # Add final layer
        final_layer = layers.LSTM(lstm_units, return_sequences=False)
        if bidirectional:
            final_layer = layers.Bidirectional(final_layer)
        lstm_layers.append(final_layer)
        self.lstm_layers = lstm_layers

        # Small MLP at the end
        self.head = MLP(num_dense_layers, vocab_size, hidden_dim)
        
    def call(self, x):
        # Mask zero values in input (ignored by LSTM)
        mask = utils.make_padding_mask(x)
        mask = tf.cast(mask, tf.bool)
        x = self.embed(x)
        for lstm in self.lstm_layers:
            x = lstm(x, mask=mask)
        return self.head(x)


This takes a sequence as input and returns a softmaxed vector over my vocabulary size. I am then using crossentropy to train to predict the next word correctly. But my loss decreases only a little at first and then stays quite high. The model learns to always predict ""the"" as the next word.
Why won't it learn anything? I have tried larger/smaller models (including a huge model with 30million parameters), playing with learning rate, using label smoothing, increasing vocab size, different sequence lengths, and nothing seems to work. Is this problem simply too hard? Is there something fundamentally flawed in my approach?
I'm learning NLP and would appreciate any insight.

Should I be layer freezing when fine-tuning an LLM?,"
I've had it in my head that generally speaking, it's better to freeze layers when fine-tuning an LLM, as per this quote from HuggingFace's article:

PEFT approaches only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model
parameters while freezing most parameters of the pretrained LLMs,
thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs. This
also overcomes the issues of catastrophic forgetting, a behaviour
observed during the full finetuning of LLMs. PEFT approaches have also
shown to be better than fine-tuning in the low-data regimes and
generalize better to out-of-domain scenarios. It can be applied to
various modalities, e.g., image classification and stable diffusion
dreambooth.

I think what I might be confused by is what is meant by the ""(extra)"" part. It led me to try fine-tuning a BERT model in PyTorch by freezing all parameters except for the final feed-forward of the transformer responsible for sequence classification:
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = False

for param in model.classifier.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True

However, this caused my model to get significantly worse evaluation metrics on my test set than before I did this. This lead me to the following conclusions:

My dataset of ~100K datapoints is not of a ""low-data regime"" and therefore doesn't benefit from PEFT? But doesn't it say this generalizes better to ""out-of-domain scenarios""? How do I know the particular seq classification I'm doing with BERT is out-of-domain? Because it isn't specifically a next-sequence prediction task?

Is this the cost of misinterpreting the ""(extra)"" model parameters part? I'm fine-tuning a small number of extant model parameters here, not extra.


I'm just confused here. The quote I've showed here makes me believe my PEFT model should've outperformed a regular fine-tuning.

What is the impact of the initialization of weights in the performance of a neural network in machine learning?,"
In my own experience, weight initialization matters for model convergence.

Theoretically, can different weight initialization methods eventually converge to the same optimal solution? Are their weight initialization methods theoretically proven to be worse than others?
Is there research into what weight initialization methods work best across the board for different kinds of architectures?

","['machine-learning', 'convergence', 'weights-initialization']","Progress about how to best initialize the weights, is what has made neural networks to be popular again.Initially (around the 80s I think), NNs were initialized from Normal distributions like $\mathcal{N}(0, I)$, but that caused unstable training prone to divergence. Also, initializing the weights (excluding the biases) to be constant is something you would NEVER do because the weights with same values are updated in the exactly the same way: so these will be just redundant, not helping the network to learn. Therefore, you want to pick random weights, but how?Are there weight initialization methods theoretically proven to be worse than others?Is there research into what weight initialization methods work best across the board for different kinds of architectures?Consider that the choice of which weight initialization scheme to utilize should be made according to what activation function to use in your model, and in some cases is also related to the network architecture. So, weight init and activation are strictly related.Indeed, this does not necessarily mean that e.g. using Glorot with ReLU is always bad. But these two papers provide an analysis of the variance of the weights with different initialization strategies, being designed to keep that in control.A note about pre-training (also related to transfer learning): strictly speaking this is not a weight initialization strategy. Indeed, you can pick a popular architecture and download the weights pre-trained on ImageNet (for example); that would give a nice initial point, useful to speed-up convergence, down-steams tasks, and even when having few training data. I consider pre-training to be a second step, because the first time you have to pre-train the model yourself and so starting from a proper weight initialization is beneficial also for pre-training alone."
Do batches need to be sequential in Transformer traning?,"
When training a transformer model (I'm using nn.TransformerEncoder from pytorch) is it better to use sequential batches (for example, three sequences [[1,2,3,4], [5,6,7,8], [9,10,11,12]] where next sequence continues where the previous ended)?
Or can I use non-sequential or randomly picked sequences from my dataset (for example, here are three randomly picked sequences [[1,2,3,4], [56, 57, 58, 59], [22, 23, 24, 25]])?
I can make a test myself, but I was just wondering if that's already known.
","['transformer', 'pytorch']","Each sample in each batch is processed separately. Each batch in turn is handled separately. Having consistency between batches is not going to improve the convergence of your model.If any, it might result in a less generalized model because your data is not shuffled enough."
Should I downsample because of overrepresentation of geographic locations in time series data,"
I am in the start of working with a project where I am hoping to be able to classify activities based time series data. I have historic data; lat/long/speed/(..) as well as the activity.
The challenge is that I have two sources for these data - one is having a short range but high detection (fixed equipment on ground) and the other have high range and low detection (satellite). This means that there is a 10-1 amount of data in favor for the source with short range. But the coverage for the high range is twice as good.
I worry that this will lead to that the data that is picked up by the short range detection will be overrepresented in any future classifications.
One idea I have is to down sample the data to a time-scale where the time-density of the data is more or less the same, which means bringing the high detection source ""down"" to level with the high coverage one.

Loss function not able to capture the maxima of probability distribution,"
I am trying to predict noise (random gaussian) with the help of a neural network. I am implementing a L2 loss (torch.nn.function.mse_loss) for computing the loss function between the prediction distribution and input distribution (random gaussian). Any suggestions on what I may do to correct this?

2. For epoch 200 : Train loss 1.000555157661438

","['neural-networks', 'pytorch', 'mean-squared-error']","Gaussian noise is usually 0-mean, meaning that it cancels out on average especially with a squared loss (e.g. MSE): so your approach won't work.I think that you should instead predict the mean and variance of such noise distribution: in such a way you could handle noises that are not 0-centered too!In practice, I guess you can get inspiration from variational autoencoders. I mean, you set-up a neural net to predict the mean and log-variance. Then the loss function will be the KL divergence between the predicted Gaussian distribution (the one parametrized by mean and exp(log_var)) and the Gaussian prior, which corresponds to the distribution that describes the noise: $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$, in your case.In principle, with such approach you can learn also non-Gaussian noise distributions."
fine-tune nanoGPT for instructions,"
I've been playing around with nanoGPT, and recently I decided I wanted to fine-tune it using the dolly instruction set. This data set consists of roughly 15k examples and each example has the following features: question-type, context, instruction, and response. For my first go around at fine-tuning nanoGPT, I threw away the question-type feature, and then prefixed the other categories with ""CONTEXT: "", ""INSTRUCTION: "", ""RESPONSE: "" respectively, I then proceeded to concatenate them all together, tokenize them, and then train nanoGPT on the resulting text. That worked fine, for the most part, but now I want to train nanoGPT in a slightly different way.
The other way I would like to train nanoGPT is as follows: I again prefix each of the categories, but this time I would like to only concatenate the context and instruction together. The training loop I would like to use is something like this: input the the context and instruction together, let the model generate a response, and then compare that with response in dolly (e.g. take the cross-entropy loss between the generated response and the response from the dataset). The problem with this is that the way nanoGPT works (as far as I can tell), you feed in a block of text (usually 1024 tokens) and the target is that same block of text but shifted by 1, and the loss is computed between the next token and the output. Essentially, the forward call for nanoGPT only gives the probability distribution for the next character given the block. So it would seem that I need to either change the model somehow (which is undesirable), or I need to change the training loop. Now, in nanoGPT, there is a generate method, but it is explicitly decorated with a @torch.no_grad(). I've tried commenting out this decorator, but run into problems when doing so.
So I am at a bit of a loss of what to do from here. If anyone has any suggestions or know of any resources, I'd be very grateful. I am still quite new to this stuff so I am not sure what I am hoping to do is even reasonable.
Thanks!

Issues with larger context lengths in a transformer model like GPT,"
Based on my understanding, one of the issues with longer context lengths is the computational complexity of attention mechanism which is quadratic. But is this really a problem on modern hardware with parallel CPU's?
Eg: 32k context length (GPT4) has a complexity of O(32k * 32k) which is O(1024 million).
Are there any other issues apart from the above which are impeding transformer models from supporting larger context lengths?
As a side note, even if larger context lengths leads to slower non-interactive responses, I think it can still be very helpful in a lot of scenarios

Difference in gradient calculation for the last layer activation in neural networks,"
I'm currently working on implementing a neural network using the sigmoid activation function and the binary cross-entropy cost function. In my implementation, I've noticed that the gradient calculation for the last layer activation differs from other layers. I'm seeking a clear explanation or proof for this discrepancy.
Specifically, I'm curious about why the gradient calculation for the last layer is different and whether it's influenced by the choice of cost function and activation function. Additionally, I would appreciate insights into why we can't simply use the formula dAL = d(cost) / d(AL) = d(cost) / d(ZL) * d(ZL) / d(AL) for calculating gradients in all layers. so we don't want to find da_prev using this np.dot(W.T, dZ), we compute it using a different approach. I'm eager to understand the rationale behind this choice.
Any explanations, proofs, or insights into the reasons behind these gradient calculations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your help and guidance!

MobileNet validation loss not decreasing over time,"

I have a poor dataset, where of the training data has a single object labelled in the image.
Same for the validation set even though I reserved the best (more general and well labelled) to then select the best weights.
As far as I can tell, it seems that the model learns to identify many objects, sometimes very well and sometimes not, even though there is a single one labelled (but many images will have several of these object kinds)
I am thinking of re-labeling the data with the current model, and retrain it.
I get that once the model learns to distinguish an object to minimize the error with the dataset, it may also learn to identify other objects in the image.
However, I wonder this:

Would the process of back-propagation punish this extra detections, when the images contain a single labelled object but the model detects many (including the correct one) ?

Word Embeddings but for Logical reasoning in custom knowledge GPT-3.5 bot,"
So I have created a chatbot using GPT-3.5 turbo. I have a vector database that holds vector embeddings of brands, ratings, commission percentages, outlets, tags, etc. Here's how the system is designed.

User Asks a question.
The question is converted to vector embeddings using gpt-3 ada embedding model.
The converted vector is searched in Milvus vector database using L2 Method.
The fetched content is then used to create a custom knowledge context.
This custom context is added in prompt for gpt3.5
We send the created prompt to gpt3.5 turbo and answer user.

The Problem:
The system is working perfectly. The problem is that this system is designed to work on similarity searches. This means users can ask for brands selling pizza, burgers, etc. Anything that is keyword based is fine. But when users search for the highest commission, highest rating, or highest-rated pizza brand. The results are random because the results are based on similarity not logical reasoning.
I want to know a way to do this. When a user asks a logic-based question that needs reasoning we can somehow find out the correct brands from the database/vector database and then send that brand to gpt3.5 in a prompt.
I'm open to ideas but don't want to use a rule-based bot.
TIA.

Someone has already asked a question about this. But I implemented the suggestion made in the comments without success. So I was wondering if anybody had a better idea.
I changed the mutation power for the bias and the weights to 5. And the number of genomes roughly doubles after every generation. Consequently the genetic algorithm is taken ages.
Is there any solution for this?

Any suggestion on what I should try to get this cVAE model working for random generation of new molecules?,"
I am using a cVAE model to generate new structures of molecules. After successfully training the VAE model I am able to get proper reconstructions of the training set. While I am also able to generate decent structures  (near correct) when I use the unseen testing dataset. (i.e given a test molecule, I first pass it into the encoder; generate the latent vector and then produce a reconstruction from the decoder.)
But when I am randomly sampling my latent vector (z) from a Gaussian distribution (normal Gaussian), then the decoded results are not correct. i.e. sample a random vector torch.randn(dim(z)) of the dimension of the latent space and pass it through the decoder. The outputs of this result are nowhere valid.
I have tried to visualise the latent space according to the class conditional as well, and the latent space looks fairly good, pretty much the same as cVAEs. i.e. distributed uniformly across the origin in all directions. The 2-Dimensional and 3-Dimensional latent space distribution looks like the following.
Any suggestion on what I should try to get this cVAE model working for random generation of new molecules?

","['deep-learning', 'variational-autoencoder']","The problem with autoencoders (conditional or not) is usually the poor structure of the learned latent space. The reconstruction loss guide the decoder to map from $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ to $\mathcal{D}$ (being your target distrbution) but it does not provide any information about independent features being present within $\mathcal{D}$ and no geometric structure is therefore learned, as your PCA visualisation show.You can try two approaches to improve your model with the specific intent of generating unseen data:Add classes to enforce the latent space to learn independent features per each class. In this scenario cross entropy can be use to train the encoder to classify the given input. This obviously require having classes information available along with the input data. (in the picture the upper part)Move to an adversarial approach. GANs are better than VAE in generating unseen data, and fortunately the two are not mutually exclusive. I strongly advise to read Adversarial Latent Autoencoders. This approach differs from traditional GANs cause it leverages adversarial training to learn proper latent representation rather than proper generated data, putting a patch on the weak point of VAEs."

Shape of biases in Transformer's Feedforward Network,"
In transformer network (Vaswani et al., 2017), the feedforward networks have equation:
$$\mathrm{FNN}(x) = \max(0, xW_1 + b_1) W_2 + b_2$$
where $x \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_\mathrm{model}}$, $W_1 \in\mathbb{R}^{d_\mathrm{model} \times d_{ff}}$, $W_2 \in\mathbb{R}^{d_{ff} \times d_\mathrm{model}}$.
We know that the biases $b_1$ and $b_2$ are vectors.
But, for the equation to work the shape of $b_1$ and $b_2$ must agree, i.e., $b_1 \in\mathbb{R}^{n \times d_{ff}}$ and $b_2 \in\mathbb{R}^{n \times d_\mathrm{model}}$.
My question: is it true that
$b_1 = \begin{bmatrix} (b_1)_{1} & (b_1)_{2} & \dots & (b_1)_{d_{ff}}\\ (b_1)_{1} & (b_1)_{2} & \dots & (b_1)_{d_{ff}} \\ \vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots \\ (b_1)_{1} & (b_1)_{2} & \dots & (b_1)_{d_{ff}} \end{bmatrix}$
and
$b_2 = \begin{bmatrix} (b_2)_{1} & (b_2)_{2} & \dots & (b_2)_{d_\mathrm{model}}\\ (b_2)_{1} & (b_2)_{2} & \dots & (b_2)_{d_\mathrm{model}} \\ \vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots \\ (b_2)_{1} & (b_2)_{2} & \dots & (b_2)_{d_\mathrm{model}} \end{bmatrix}$ ?
","['transformer', 'feedforward-neural-networks', 'linear-algebra']","The biases are vectors, and their shape should be $b_1\in \mathbb R^{d_{ff}}$ and $b_2\in \mathbb R^{d_\text{model}}$.To verify that let's compute the shapes of the above formula (for simplicity we can exclude the $\max$):
$$\begin{align}
xW_1 &= (n\times d_\text{model})\times (d_\text{model}\times d_{ff}) = n\times d_{ff} \\
(xW_1)W_2 &= (n\times d_{ff})\times (d_{ff}\times d_\text{model}) = n\times d_\text{model}
\end{align}
$$In practice, according to the underlying implementation the biases can be either:In the first two cases, the biases are stored as vectors. I'm not aware of implementations that keeps the biases as matrices (i.e. replicated vectors) also because the batch size $n$ is not said to remain fixed: e.g. on inference it's tipically one."
Homography matrix of two boards on same plane,"
The theory
homography is defined like this:
$H=1/r_3*\begin{bmatrix}  
f_{x} & 0 & C_x\\  
0 & f_{y} & C_y\\  
0 & 0 & 1\\
\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}  
t_{11} & t_{12} &  r_{1}\\  
t_{21} & t_{22} &  r_{2}\\  
t_{31} & t_{32} &  r_{3}\\
\end{bmatrix}$
with some help of symbolic octave:
$H=1/r_3*\begin{bmatrix}  
c_x*t_{31} + f_x*t_{11}& c_x*t_{32} + f_x*t_{12}& c_x*r_{3} + fx*r_{1}\\
c_y*t_{31} + f_y*t_{21}& c_y*t_{32} + f_y*t_{22}& c_y*r_{3} + fy*r_{2}\\
t_{31}& t_{32}& r_{3}
\end{bmatrix}$
The 3rd row of H is:
$H_{3}=1/r_3*\begin{bmatrix}  
t_{31}& t_{32}& r_{3}
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}  
t_{31}/r_3& t_{32}/r_3& r_{3}/r_3
\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}  
t_{31}/r_3& t_{32}/r_3& 1.0
\end{bmatrix}$
Now lets say I have image of two squares lying on the  same plane, only shifted through $X$ axis , this is my model:

The square 2 is identical to square 1, but shifted with amount of 2 units in X axis.
I must state that both squares are on the X-Y plane, i.e. both have same rotation matrix against the camera coordinates. i.e. the first two rows of both extrinsic matrices are same.
Thus for first object, the last row of homography matrix is:
$H_{3,1}=\begin{bmatrix}  t_{31}/r_{3,1}& t_{32}/r_{3,1}& 1.0\end{bmatrix}$
For second object, the last row of homography matrix is:
$H_{3,2}=\begin{bmatrix}  t_{31}/r_{3,2}& t_{32}/r_{3,2}& 1.0\end{bmatrix}$
Member wise divide:
$H_{3,1} ./ H_{3,2}=\begin{bmatrix}  r_{3,2}/r_{3,1}& r_{3,2}/r_{3,1}& 1.0\end{bmatrix}$
As obvious the first two members are equal ($r_{3,2}/r_{3,1}$).
Real world example
In action, these are values of computed homography matrices for above image:
$H_1 =\begin{bmatrix}
154.05&115.29&27\\
31.83&-70.807&252\\
-0.057042&0.11161&1\\
\end{bmatrix}$
$H_2 =\begin{bmatrix}
178.42&127.13&374 \\
41.677&-80.555&354 \\
-0.044259&0.1161&1
\end{bmatrix}$
Note that I've double checked both matrices values and there where no error.
the ratio: $\alpha = H_2 ./ H_1$ (member wise divide)
$=\begin{bmatrix}
0.86341&0.90685&0.072193\\
0.76375&0.87899&0.71186\\
1.2888&0.96135&1
\end{bmatrix}$
As you can see the member $\alpha_{3,1}=1.2888$ and $\alpha_{3,2}=0.96135$ are not equal or even close together, but based on theory section, they should be equal.

Does ChatGPT use different transformers for different downstream tasks?,"
What I find hard to figure out is whether ChatGPT guesses from the prompt the downstream NLP task to be performed - text summary, text generation, question-answering, doing logic or arithmetic, translation,  sentiment or style analysis - and then uses specialized decoders/transformers. Or if there is only one transformer which handles all downstream tasks. How then can it be understood that ChatGPT performs so well in so many tasks - as if it used specialized transformers.
If it guesses the task: How is it done (in high-level terms) and how does it switch?
The answer may be so clear (for the experts) that it is never mentioned explicitly, but for the non-expert it is hard to tell (and to believe).
(Maybe it's easier to answer the question if there is a specific and specifically trained transformer for each supported language.)
BTW: Why is the task ""to follow instructions"" (which InstructGPT is said to be specialized for) a task on its own? Isn't every prompt an instruction in a sense, instructing ChatGPT to perform some downstream task?

Initializing the first word embedding layer in transformers with random values works fine but Wouldn't initializing transformers with pre-trained word embedding speed up the training of transformers?
Isn't starting with pre-trained word embedding(vectors that have semantic meaning) is better than starting from scratch?

Constraints Satisfaction for Perfect Matchings,"
Consider the problem of finding a perfect matching for a graph $G$ as a constraint satisfaction
problem where the variables are the vertices and there is just one global constraint (which
does not depend on the edges of $G$):
My formulation of it is:
Variables: A random subset of $|V|/2$ nodes $V'$
Domain: $V \backslash V'$
Constraints: $Alldiff(val(v_1,v_2,...,v_{|V|/2}))$ for $v_i \in V'$ and $(v_i,val(v_i)) \in E$
Constraint solvers generally use a mixture of constraint propagation methods (e.g., k-consistency, generalised arc consistency) and search methods (e.g., backtracking search).
Does this formulation allow the solver to decide in all cases whether a given graph has a perfect matching simply by using some standard form of constraint propagation (i.e., without using any search)?
I think that it's false because if we consider the complete graph of |V| nodes, any form arc consistency won't necessarily reduce the search space, but I'm not sure.

Consequence of Dvoretzky Stochastic Approximation Theorem,"
I am trying to understand all the steps to prove the TD0 algorithm, and I am following a proof which uses a theorem of Tommi Jaakkola, Michael I. Jordan and Satinder P. Singh, in the paper: On the Convergence of Stochastic Iterative
Dynamic Programming Algorithms.
For proving an extension of the Dvoretzky theorem, they first state and claim that this lemma is a standard result and that it follows from Dvoretzky theorem:
Lemma 1
A random process
$\omega_{n+1}(x) = (1-\alpha_n(x))\omega_n(x)+\beta_n(x)r_n(x)$
coverges to zero with probability one if the following conditions are satisfied:

$\sum_n\alpha(x) = \infty, \: \sum_n \alpha^2_n(x) < \infty, \: \sum_n\beta_n(x) = \infty, \: \sum_n \beta_n^2(x) < \infty,$ and  $\mathbb{E}[\beta_n(x) \mid P_n] \leq \mathbb{E}[\alpha_n(x) \mid P_n]$ uniformly with probability 1.

$\mathbb{E}[r_n(x) \mid P_n] = 0 $ and $\mathbb{E}[r_n^2(x) \mid P_n] \leq C $ w.p.1, where
$
P_n = \{\omega_n, \omega_{n-1},...,r_{n-1},r_{n-2},...,\alpha_{n-1},\alpha_{n-2},...,\beta_{n-1},\beta_{n-2},...\}.
$
All the random variables are allowed to depend on the past $P_n$


The proof in the paper is only the following:
""Except for the appearance of  $\beta_n(x)$ this is a standard result. With
the above definitions convergence follows directly from Dvoretzky's extended
theorem (Dvoretzky, 1956).""
It can be found here. This lemma appears in page 11 in the paper, in the proof of Theorem 1: Tommi Jaakkola, Michael I. Jordan and Satinder P. Singh paper
The Dvoretzky theorem is from a paper of 1956 by Aryeh Dvoretzky (On Stochastic Approximation). I will write it here:
Dvoretzky Theorem
Let $(\Omega, F, \mu)$ be a probability space and $\alpha_n$, $\beta_n$ and $\gamma_n$, $n = 1, 2, ... $ non-negative real numbers satisfying:
\begin{equation}
        \lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = 0,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\beta_n < \infty,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\gamma_n = \infty.
\end{equation}
Let $\theta$ be a real number and $T_n: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, $n = 1, 2, ... $, measurable functions satisfying
\begin{equation}
        |T_n(r_1,...,r_n) - \theta| \leq \max(\alpha_n, (1+\beta_n) |r_n - \theta| - \gamma_n)
\end{equation}
for all real numbers $r_1,...,r_n$. Let $X_1$ and $Y_n$, $n = 1, 2, ... $, be random variables. We define
\begin{equation}
        X_{n+1}(\omega) = T_n[X_1(\omega),...,X_n(\omega)] + Y_n(\omega), \quad n \geq 1.
\end{equation}
Then, the conditions
\begin{equation}
    \mathbb{E}[X_1^2] < \infty,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{E}[Y_n^2] < \infty,
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}[Y_n \mid X_1, ..., X_n] = 0
\end{equation}
w.p.1 for all $n$, imply
\begin{equation} 
 \lim_{n\to\infty}\mathbb{E}[(X_n-\theta)^2] = 0
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation} 
\mathbb{P}(\lim_{n \to \infty}X_n = \theta) = 1.
\end{equation}
And now an extension to the case where the coefficients are non-negative functions.
The theorem remains valid if $\alpha_n$, $\beta_n$ y $\gamma_n$ are replaces by non-negative functions $\alpha_n(r_1,...,r_n)$, $\beta_n(r_1,...,r_n)$ y $\gamma_n(r_1,...,r_n)$, respectively, provided they satisfy the conditions:

The functions $\alpha_n(r_1,...,r_n)$ are uniformly bounded and
\begin{equation} 
    \lim_{n\to\infty}\alpha_n(r_1,...,r_n) = 0
\end{equation}
uniformly for all sequences $r_1,...,r_n$.

The functions $\beta_n(r_1,...,r_n)$ are measurable and
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\beta_n(r_1,...,r_n)
\end{equation}
is uniformly bounded and uniformly convergent for all sequences $r_1,...,r_n$.

The functions $\gamma_n(r_1,...,r_n)$ satisfy
\begin{equation}
    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\gamma_n(r_1,...,r_n) = \infty
\end{equation}
uniformly for all sequences $r_1,...,r_n$, for which
\begin{equation}
    \sup_{n \geq 1} |r_n| < L,
\end{equation}
$L < \infty$ being an arbitrary number.


The source can be found here: Dvoretzky paper
However, I can't find a way to relate that lemma to the Dvoretzky theorem, and nor can I find papers that prove the result, as Jaakkola states. Is it actually easy to prove that from the theorem? I would appreciate any help in this matter, and it would be perfect if you could provide an article or book where they prove that, or something similar.

Regression Model overestimates in train-mode,"
I have a Deep Learning Regression model to predict some values. The results are fine when I use the model in Evaluation Mode, but when I turn Training Mode on the model tends to overestimate the predictions. (I need to use the model in training mode since I want to use Monte Carlo Dropout to estimate a probability/uncertainty for the predicted value.)
My Regression model looks like this (I use PyTorch 2.0)
class Regression(nn.Module):
def __init__(self, num_outs):
    super(Regression, self).__init__()
    self.fc1 = nn.Linear(1024, 512)
    self.fc2 = nn.Linear(512, 256)

    self.bn1 = torch.nn.BatchNorm1d(512)
    self.bn2 = torch.nn.BatchNorm1d(256)
    self.dropout = torch.nn.Dropout(0.2)

def forward(self, x):
    x = self.dropout(x)
    x = F.relu(self.bn1(self.fc1(x)))
    x = F.relu(self.bn2(self.fc2(x)))
    x = self.fc3(x)
    return x

If I plot the Training and Evaluation error I get this histogram. As expected the test error is normal distriubuted around 0. However the mean of the train error is moved to the right, which shouldnt be happening. While researching I read this article which describes a similar effect but the other way around, which makes sense to me but my behaviour is really strange since the model should optimize in train mode. I train and test on different datasets, but I get the same effect when I test on my training dataset.
I would be very thankful if someone could point me in the right direction to tackle this problem.

Excuse me if you find this question too vague and not fitting to this forum and feel free to close it. The overall goal of my question is to get a better intuition of the attention concept and mechanism.
There is a high-level analogy between attention mechanisms (to be specific: in the transformer) and Google's PageRank algorithm: both claim and strive to calculate ""relative importances"" – of parts of a sentence or of web pages – without a thorough definition of what ""importance"" actually is. The meaning of ""relative importance"" as calculated by PageRank is intuitively clear even though it's recursive: the relative importance of a web page is the sum of the relative importances of the pages linking to it. (Graph-theoretically speaking, the relative importances are given by the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix.) The idea is, that when looking for web pages on a specific topic one should pay attention to the most ""important"" web pages (which PageRank helps to find).
I wonder if the high-level analogy can be put a bit deeper: How are – for example – the mathematics of attention mechanisms related to the mathematics of PageRank – if they are? Or is the analogy too superficial and misleading and should be forgotten?
Until now I could not develop an intuitive understanding what the relative importance of a token in a sentence is (on which attention then is focussed): important with respect to what? To other tokens or the sentence or even the ""full model"" as claimed here? Or isn't the goal of attention mechanisms better explained in terms of ""what kinds of relations are there between the tokens in a sentence and between the tokens and the sentence as a whole, and how strong are they?"" That's the background of my question.
Once again: excuse the vagueness and possibly confusion of this question, I'm aware of it.

How does Monte-Carlo Tree Search Compare to MCMC?,"
Monte-Carlo Tree Search was the method used for AlphaGo my understanding is: it would randomly search the state space of possible moves where the probability of choosing a move was proportional to the perceived Value of the resulting state (this rollout data was then used to train the value function further).
This seems very similar to MCMC to me. Except that it includes a mechanism for observing ground truth likelihood (winners/losers in GO) & updating the likelihood function (aka Value function) in the process.
Is this true? And to what degree in general have Bayesian methods been used in RL?
For example have people tried using one of the various specialized MCMC algorithms to improve Monte-Carlo tree search?
Sorry if the question is open-ended/vague.

How can I send vectors as a chat context?,"
Since the context/memory of a chat or question for LLMs more precisely GPT is limited to a token length I struggle about how to provide own data that the model got not trained on.
A very common approach looks like embeddings are the way to.
OpenAI provided an article https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/Question_answering_using_embeddings.ipynb
how to create an embedding of a user query, match it against a local vector database ans provide the closest results as text to the context/memory.
Here I do struggle, since it might be very well possible that even we find the most matching documents locally in a vector database, context might still be too small if we would like to provide multiple matches.
The question to me is, how could I send all the relevant embedding vectors rather than the relevant texts which got matched to the vectors?
These vectors are highly condensed and would save a lot of tokens. GPT would anyhow be able to understand the vector since they created it from their embeddings API, right?
Or is it just not possible to convert the vector back to text at their end?
Thanks in advance for any help and explanations to understand this better.

"Computational overhead of ""SCALING FORWARD GRADIENT WITH LOCAL LOSSES""","
The paper ""SCALING FORWARD GRADIENT WITH LOCAL LOSSES"" discusses a new way of training deep neural networks called forward gradient learning. This method is different from the traditional backpropagation method. However, when applied to large networks, it can have high variance. The paper proposes some changes to the method to make it more practical for deep learning tasks. They suggest using perturbations to activations instead of weights to reduce variance. They also introduce a new architecture called LocalMixer that is better suited for local learning. The new approach performs well on standard deep learning tasks (MNIST and CIFAR-10) and outperforms other backpropagation-free algorithms on ImageNet.
Question: As the forward learning approach does not require the backpropagation pass, is it accurate to assume that forward learning (roughly speaking) achieves ~2x speedup in training compared with backpropagation, assuming all other parameters are the same such as the number of epochs, batch size .. etc?
I would get an answer to my question if I could run the code linked in the paper, I tried to run it but it failed giving the following error!

Clustering bounding boxes to reduce image cutout overlap,"
Given an image and bounding boxes identified within this image, the objective is to group these bounding boxes in such as way that we can define a bigger bounding box of size NxN that will encompass as little bounding boxes as possible while reducing the overlap between these NxN bounding boxes.
Some background to understand why this is needed. The idea is that we have full Sun images, and we want to use them to train a predictive machine learning model. To do this, we classify each of these bounding boxes into one of two classes. Now, we have available sequences of 512x512 such images and in order to train we need to extract cutouts of these regions and label these with their class. The problem comes from the low resolution of the images, meaning that simply cutting the region itself will yield an image of not high enough resolution. So one possible solution would be to just upscale these cutouts, but that means we distort the size of features, and it may affect the performance of the model. Another possibility is to simply pad the cutouts to the required size. However, I'm trying to go with a fixed cutout size, but that means that ultimately each cutout will have more than one region in it given that the cutout size is ~ 1/4 of the full image. So, what we need is to define these cutouts in such a way that there's as few as possible regions in each and the overlap between them is minimal so that we can label each cutout based on the regions it contains and then use it for training.

This is an example of what one of these images look like. The red bounding boxes are the original region bounding boxes, and the blue bounding boxes are what a cutout centred on each region would look like.
Grouping together regions that overlap, such as 4412, 4399 and 4397 should be easy. However, the problem lies in defining the blue bounding boxes. Manually, I could define three different blue bounding boxes encompassing [4412, 4399, 4397] [4386, 43974414, 4390,4392] and [4379, 4383] but I'm at a lost as to how I could do this automatically. Any suggestions or ideas, even just a name, about what method could work for this are greatly appreciated!

How Does The Scaled Dot Product's Dimensions Work Out In Mult-Head Attention?,"
I don't understand how self-attention works with batched values for the $Q \times K^T $ step. According to the diagram below (assume 1 head), once we get past the first 3 linear steps, we arrive at the equation. $$softmax(\frac{Q \, K^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V$$
Assuming Q and K have dimensions $[\text{batch}, \text{sequence}, \text{key_dim}]$, if the tensor contraction goes like $$Q \, K^T = [\text{batch}_q, \text{sequence}_q, \text{query_dim}_q] \times [\text{batch}_k, \text{key_dim}_k, \text{sequence}_k] = [\text{batch}_q, \text{batch}_k, \text{query_dim}_q, \text{key_dim}_k]$$
there is an extra batch dimension in the result.
I can avoid this extra batch dimension by doing a for-loop over the batch dimension and compute the formula 1-to-1 for each query and key. But one of the benefits of self-attention is that it's parallelizable so there must be a way to do this without a for-loop. How do I achieve this?

Are my DeepLabv3 training configurations comparable?,"
I am currently trying to compare the semantic segmentation performance of DeepLabv3 of a model being trained on data coming from the real world domain with a model trained on data coming from the real world domain on top of which I am augmenting synthesized data. The question that came up to me was whether the training scenarios I have formulated are comparable and/or whether I can draw any meaningful conclusions after evaluating the two models. Below I will describe the two configurations used for training:

In the first scenario I use a subset of 250 data examples from real world (from Cityscapes dataset), using an initial learning rate of 0.001 with a Poly decay function, a batch size of 10 examples, for 100 epochs with crop size of 321.

In the second scenario I use the same subset of 250 data examples from real world and a subset of 250 examples synthetic data examples, using an initial learning rate of 0.001 with a Poly decay function, a batch size of 10 examples, for 100 epochs with crop size of 321. The examples from both domains are sampled randomly in the subsets and after that the subsets are concatenated and the resulting dataset is shuffled, so each batch has randomly sampled examples from each domain.


I attach here the Poly learning rate decay function definition:
$$
f(x) = initialLR * (1.0 -  \frac{x}{totalNoOfIterations})^.9, 
$$
where x is the current iteration number (considering an iteration being a forward + backward pass on a batch).
What makes me question the validity of the comparison is:

The difference in the $totalNoOfIterations$ required to complete an epoch (2500 for the first scenario and 5000 for the second scenario, even though the number of epochs is the same, i.e. the datasets are both fully crossed 100 times)
The learning rate evolution, given that it depends on the total $totalNoOfIterations$.

What is the intuition behind position-encoding?,"
It is clear that word positions are essential for the meaning of a sentence, and so are essential when feeding a sentence (= sequence of words) as a matrix of word embedding vectors into a transformer. I also have understood roughly how positions are encoded, but what I did not understand in the very begining is why just creating a matrix consisting of a number of word embedding vectors (as columns) with the columns in the same order as the words in the sentence does not suffice. A matrix with permutated columns obviously would ""mean"" something different - and sometimes nothing at all - like a pixel matrix would change its ""meaning"" when we permutated some pixel columns. Is there an intuitive explanation why position encoding vectors have to be added to the word embedding vectors. Why and how would the position information (which is still present in the input matrix) get lost otherwise?
(I have learned in the meanwhile that transformers are in general not permutation invariant, but that there are transformers that are: set transformers.)

How does a Machine Learning model predict this classification problem?,"
Let’s imagine we want to create a simple Sentiment Analysis model using Machine Learning not Deep Learning algorithms, so we need to have a set of handcrafted features for this classification problem.
Let's say we have 2 features (F1, F2) for each sentence and a target class consisting of 0 and 1 as positive and negative. So we have a bunch of sentences in a dataset like this:

Well, classification algorithms like SVM, LR, DT, and …. can be trained from the training set and learn the sentiment of each sentence from their features. They can also test themselves using the test set. Now the model is ready to predict the sentiment of any sentence out of the dataset. Till now, there is no problem and everything is clear to me.
My problem is when we want to give a new sentence to the model form outside the dataset. Obviously, when we give a sentence to the model, we don’t give any feature to the model. So here is my question, how the model can predict the sentiment of the new sentence when it doesn’t know how to calculate each of the features?
Should we define what is F1, and F2 in the model first? Should we define a function and for any new input sentence, call the function to calculate the proper value for each feature and then teach the model that the function outputs are equal to F1 and F2 in the dataset?
To make a long question shorter, let me give a clear instance. My new sentence is ""She was overjoyed when saw my cat"". I want to give this sentence to the model and obviously expect to see a predicted positive sentiment. This sentence is not in my dataset so there is no feature for it and the model has no idea about F1 and F2. On the other hand, my model learned to determine the sentiment of each sentence using F1 and F2. So back to my question, when I don't give new sentence features (F1, F2) to my model and don't specify any procedure to calculate the features for new inputs, how the model can predict the sentiment of my new sentences?

Updated:
As an example of a classification problem, I mentioned the article
"" A Pattern-Based Approach for Sarcasm Detection on Twitter,"" Click here! where the authors proposed four sets of features that cover the different types of sarcasm.
They used those to classify tweets as sarcastic and non-sarcastic.
These features are sentiment-related features, Punctuation-related features, Syntactic and semantic
features, and Pattern features. For instance, in sentiment-related features, they checked whether there
is a contrast between the different components. By contrast,
they mean the coexistence of a negative component and a
positive one within the same tweet. Once the features are extracted, they ran the classification using classifiers like
(SVM).
So till now, everything is clear, with those features they trained their model and then test it with the test set.
The question is when they wanna check the classification for a new sentence, say x for instance, obviously, we should
calculate all four sets of features for the new input x.
Assume that G(x) is a function that gets a new sentence x and returns four sets of features for it (F1,F2,F3, F4), where (F1 = Sentiment-relatedfeatures, F2 = Punctuation-related features, F3 = Syntactic and semantic features, F4 = Pattern features)
How should I show the model to use these features (F1,...,F4) to predict the class for this new sentence (x)?
We have such a code: Ypred = model.predict(x, F1,F2,F3,F4); how the model should know to use F1,...F4 features in the
same way as its train or test phase?
","['machine-learning', 'natural-language-processing', 'classification', 'text-classification', 'feature-extraction']","when I don't give new sentence features (F1, F2) to my model and don't specify any procedure to calculate the features for new inputs, how the model can predict the sentiment of my new sentences?It just cannot.Any supervised ML model can be seen as a function of some set of features $x$, i.e. $\hat{y} = f(x)$. Since you describe the actual input (the sentence) with two features $F_1$ and $F_2$, and you don't provide them to the model you can't predict on new sentences.Conversely, if you try to learn another model, say $\hat F = g(s)$, that maps a sentence $s$ to the features, you need to figure out how to encode the sentence to a fixed-length representation. But if you can already do it then there is no point at learning the model $g$ at all, since you can directly learn $f$ instead also dropping the two features.I think your problem setup is a bit ill posed, you should encode the sentences either with an n-gram approach or with a vocabulary lookup to a dense embedding (instead of one-hot encodings of words.), and then train directly the model to predict the sentiment given the class variable, so skipping the two features.Update: Assuming you can can compute a set of features $F$ for each sentence, like done in the paper you linked, you need to train a multi-class classifier (e.g. a decision tree, random forest, SVM, or even neural-network) on six classes from $1$ (highly non-sarcastic) to $6$ (highly sarcastic): otherwise you can define just two classes, sarcastic vs non-sarcastic. The way you train the classifier is by pairing features $F$ and targets $y$ (i.e. the desired class label.) So you build a training dataset $\mathcal{D}_{train}=\{F_i, y_i\}_i^N$ for each training sentence $s_i$ ($N$ in total), and a validation dataset (that you can obtain from $\mathcal{D}_{train}$ by taking a random $20\%$ for example). Your train the model, like model.fit(F, y), and then evaluate the performance on a test set $\mathcal{D}_{test} = \{F_j\}_j^M$ for each new sentence $s_j$. Note that for the new sentences you don't have a class label (you want to predict that) but you have only to compute their features $F$. To predict the new classes you do something like: y_pred = model.predict(F_test), where F_test are the features of the test sentences, i.e. $\mathcal{D}_{test}$. Finally, for building/training and evaluating a classifier have a look at scikit-learn (DTs, RF, SVM) or Keras (for NNs).Basically, to both train and test the model you only need to provide the computed features $F$ as input, and not also the sentence: such kind of models cannot learn directly from words, and so from sentences."

What are the limitations of hierarchical reinforcement learning?,"
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning is suited to tackle many complex problems such as robotics manipulation. Sticking to this example, the basic idea is that instead of learning a sequence of robotic joint motions, we can learn a sequence of high level actions (e.g. grab, release, flip, etc.) and low level implementations of those actions.
Yet, I do not see much work being carried in this direction and I don't know of any impressive success story. What are the current limitations stopping hierarchical reinforcement learning to be more widely applied?
My current guess is that Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning requires some manual problem-specific work in building the high-level state space, which limits the scalability and reuse of the solutions. Still, this does not feel to be a serious issue.

Is the problem of Language Modelling a Well-Posed Learning Problem?,"
Hadamard defines (Well-posed problem (Wikipedia)) a well-posed problem as one for which:

a solution exists,
the solution is unique,
the solution depends continuously on the data (e.g. it is stable)

Now for an autoregressive language model, the pretaining objective consists of predicting the next token given all previous tokens. But as I see it, while the objective helps the model pick nuances of the language and learn ""language representation"", there is no ""correct"" answer.
Given the example, say, ""I would love to have some ____"", ""chocolate"" is just as ""correct"" as ""coffee"".
Thus, the solution is not ""unique"" as required by the definition.
But again, we could think of the problem as taking as input all the previous tokens and returning a probability distribution over the whole vocabulary. In this way of looking at the problem, the solution, i.e., the probability distribution, is unique.
So, is the problem of language modelling well-posed?
Is either of the two approaches the right reason? If not, what is the correct reason?

NUMA effects on single-process inference,"
I've been reading this article, which explains some of the effects of a multi-cpu, hyperthreaded system and suggests ways to get around the issues. Namely: put each problem domain on its own socket; that is, if I'm running a model, then run a copy of the model on each socket.
However, what if my use-case is a LLM/transformer outputting text. Just inference, no training. Due to the sequential nature of the process, the essential effect of applying the ""optimizations"" there is to run on one socket, and ignore the rest of the machine.
There's only one batch, and only one worker, so the server, on an 8-socket system, would be 88% idle.
I'm interested in what it would take to run on all the numa nodes simultaneously. Assuming no specific optimizations save perhaps avoiding hyperthreaded cores, where would performance end up at on a typical multi-socket system? The reason to do so is that 3-5 year old servers can be had with 10x the memory of new GPU based systems for 1/10th the price, with chips for as little as 2% of their original prices. And I'm wondering if there would be any benefit of a many-socket system over say a 1-socket or 2-socket one, for the throughput of a single, albeit very large, model.
Basically, comparing eight Xeon 8180Ms to say a single epyc rome 7702P. Which would 'win' at this task?
The interesting part is that model weights, during inference, do not change. So, I have this huge chunk of data which is being read by the processors. So if this is cached locally, if that matters, could lead to what should be close to linear performance scaling.
If I add more memory than the model needs; say 192GB per socket for a 120GB model (30B parameters @ fp32/AVX), would pytorch know 'out of the box' that it could cache using the extra memory to keep all accesses of the model weights local? Or is there some numactl command for this?
What happens if the model is too big for the memory of one socket, but still much smaller than the memory in the system?

Why learning with backward process is need in diffusion model despite knowing $q(x_{t-1}|x_t)$,"
I recently learnt about the diffusion model in deep learning, can someone explain to me if we can induce noise to an input data and make it a gaussian like data, why can't we use the same process in reverse without training a network for denoising to deconstruct the gaussian data to the real image?

Where does the term $\log \mu(u \mid s)$ come from?,"
This question comes from trying to build a SAC model. The action space is derived from a log normal distribution.
If in the appendix c of the original paper the equation for the log policy is:
$\log \pi(a|s) = \log \mu(u|s) - \sum^D_{i = 1} \log (1 - \tanh^2(u_i))$
where $u \in R^D$ is a random variable, $\mu(u|s)$ is the corresponding density wit infinite support (in this case being a Gaussian distribution.)
So, my question is, according to the code, the log probabilities are calculated using the following:
$\log \mu(u|s) = -0.5 \times \log(2 \times \pi) \times n + \sum (-0.5 \times \epsilon^2 - \log \sigma^2) $
where $\epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$
n = size of log_std vector
The implementation on stable baseline is more complicated.
I want to know where this formula come from because doesn't look normal pdf or log normal pdf.
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma})^2} \\
\frac{1}{x \sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}} e^{ -( \frac{\log(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2})}
\end{equation}
Further elaborations on implementations that i'm trying to understand:
Example 1: Look up log_proba here
The log probability is defined as:
$\log \pi_\theta = -0.5 \times (n \times \log(2 \pi) + logdetvar + quadratic)$
where logdetvar is the log determinant of the variance or $\log(det(M)) = trace(\log(M))$
where quadratic seems to be the row sum of ($x - \mu$) and the negative variance.
and finally $n$ is the number of rows in the log variance.
So example exmaple 1 doesn't look like the either pdf.
Example 2: Stable baselines 3 normal distribution
Stable baselines defines the log probability of the normal distribution as:
$-((X - \mu)^2) / (2 \times \sigma^2) - \log(\sigma) - \log((2\pi)^2) $
Again nothing like the pdf of the normal. Can someone explain how they are deriving these different implementations, and where do they come from?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'deep-rl', 'soft-actor-critic']","The SAC algorithm was designed for control and robotics tasks in mind, i.e. environments with continuous states and actions spaces.In practice, SAC implements a policy that is called a Squashed Gaussian (read here): is a Gaussian distribution that is bounded (or squashed) to output actions within the $[-1, 1]$ interval by a $\tanh$ operation. Intuitively, you can think of it as $a \sim \tanh(\mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma))$. This is because the Gaussian is unbounded having support in $[-\infty, \infty]$, and so limiting the actions was done by truncating the distribution which is not much clever, and in fact usually results in lower performance: I guess because you have no gradients when actions fall outside  the desired range, instead the tanh provides a continuous yet bounded interval. (An alternative to the squashed gaussian could be a Beta distribution that is in $[0, 1]$, instead, as motivated here - but I think almost nobody uses that.)Now, the term $\mu(u\mid s)$ corresponds to the underlying Gaussian distribution that outputs/samples actions $u$, providing they probability to occur. But since the $\tanh$ is applied you have to correct such probability, since you want to evaluate $\log \pi(a\mid a)$ instead of $\log \mu(u\mid s)$. In few words, the correction factor is equal to the inverse of the Jacobian determinant of the tanh transformation. So you compute the probability of the Gaussian policy $\mu(u\mid s)$ then multiply by the Jacobian, and finally take the log to obtain the log-prob of the squashed actions $a$.If you're interested in how this is done in practice check the official and these (1 and 2) other implementations. As a side note, if you use tools like tensorflow-probability you can implement this quite easily by applying a Tanh bijector to a Normal distribution.Update: log of the Normal pdf.
The Normal $\mathcal{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$ pdf of a sample $x$ (e.g. actions) is defined as follows:$$\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac12 \big(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\big)}$$Now, in RL you care about the logarithm of such probability density. So:$$\log\Big(\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac12 \big(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\big)}\Big) \\ = \log\Big(\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\Big) + \log\Big(e^{-\frac12 \big(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\big)}\Big) \\ = -\log\sigma -\log\sqrt{2\pi} - \frac12\big(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\big)^2$$Which is the same formula SB and pytorch implements."

Reproducing Knowledge Distillation on MNIST data,"
I'm trying to implement Knowledge Distillation, specifically to reproduce the MNIST example given in the paper. My (PyTorch) implementation can be found here.
I would expect it is very self-evident that using this method indeed improves results (e.g., like in other cases I tried: dropout for generalization loss, BatchNorm for speed of training, etc.). But I couldn't get the taught network to be better than the ""vanilla"" student network - playing with different architectures (with/without dropout, with/without BatchNorm, different number of hidden layers, hidden layer size, etc.), and with different hyperparameters (learning rate, dropout rate, etc.). I also tried using only the soft-targets, as well as combining it with the hard-targets as described in the paper.
My teacher network didn't reach the 99.3% reported in the paper (= 67 errors), but was close (a bit below 99%) so I'm not sure if it's just a matter of training more. But if this is the case - it makes it that the benefits of using this method are extremely small. I did manage once to get better results with the taught network - but it was only in the first epoch, and with much lower accuracies. When trained for longer epochs, the regular student outperformed.
That being said - maybe I'm doing something wrong?

Is reinforcement learning the correct approach for power source location?,"
I am trying to attack a problem for my thesis and I feel RL is the correct framework for this problem, however I am completely new to this topic and I am not sure about it.
The idea of the problem is to locate the position of a power source, in order to obtain the position I can perform several questions asking if the source is located in that interval. If the source is inside the interval I will obtain higher power, in other case the received power will be lower (stochastically). Additionally, if the interval is greater or smaller the received power change, the most narrow the interval the greater the power.
In my personal opinion the problem fits quite well the idea of reinforcement learning of discovering an environment by an agent. However, I do know how to model the rewards (maybe with the received power). Finally, the biggest problem is related to the states, in the RL literature I read about ""gridworld"" or similar problems but in my case I do not feel comfortable defining the state space. I thought about compute the posterior distribution in a Bayesian sense and using that distribution as state.
Thank you in advance and sorry for my English. If you have some recommendation about RL literature to strong my knowledge I would appreciate it.
EDIT:
Suppose we have a noisy function $f(x)$ where $x\in[-10,10]$. The idea is try to find the value $x^*$ which maximimize the function. For that, we can try $K$ different intervals $A_t=[a_t,b_t]$ with $t=1,\dots,K$. For example $A_1 = [-1,0]$, $A_2=[-10,0]$, etc.
For each tested interval we obtain a sample $y_t$ which depends on two factors:

If the optimum $x^*$ is inside the interval, the average power of $y_t$ will be higher.
The width of the interval, in other words, if $x^*=0.5$ and the tested interval si $[0,1]$, the average power of $y_t$ will be higher than using $[-10,10]$.

The action space would be the intervals $A_t$ and the state space is my doubt. I thought about computing the posterior distribution of the parameter $x*$ and update after each new sample $y_t$, therefore each state $S_t$ would be the posterior probability distribution computed with the samples $\{y_1,y_2,...,y_{t-1}\}$. I mean $p_t(x^*|y_1,\dots,y_{t-1})$.

Can an RNN predict a sinus curve with no input?,"
I read a number of tutorials on how to make an RNN (simple, LSTM, etc.) that predicts a sinus curve. They all use as an input (x) in every step a set of past sinus values.
I am wondering if THEORETICALLY and if yes, practically as well, can an RNN be constructed that takes no input (or if technically needed one x = 1) and still predicts a sinus curve?
A bit of details:
Let's assume that the ""inputs"" (but as said the input is none) are coming on a time scale equidistantly and the expected output is a sinus curve. The timestep is significantly smaller than 2PI and the ratio to 2PI is non-rational (i.e. the same value is never repeated). E.g. assume that the timestep is 0.1 (so more than 62 points for one cycle). The feedback for backpropagation can be anything, like the sinus value that was expected, or the error square, or anything else. The number of cell states is also freely choosable.
When I tried to construct such a model, instead of a predicted sinus curve, I got a moving average of past values.
Extra version (if the above simple could work): Let there be one input parameter, that is the time passed since the last point. The expected prediction is again, the sinus value after that passed time. Here again, we can assume that the time steps (not equidistant in this case) are still significantly smaller than the cycle length of sinus.

Logically, these two sentences mean exactly the same thing: ""Trump was the worst president since Obama."" and ""Trump was a better president than Obama."".  Can an AI tell that their intended meanings are quite different?
ChatGPT
Yes, an AI can understand that the intended meanings of the two sentences are quite different.
While the literal meaning of the two sentences may appear similar, the context in which they are used changes the meaning entirely.
The first sentence implies that Trump was a worse president than all the presidents who came after Obama.
It also suggests that Obama was a better president than Trump.
On the other hand, the second sentence implies that Trump was a better president than Obama.
This statement could be true or false, depending on one's political perspective and beliefs.
An AI model like GPT-3 is capable of analyzing the context and inferring the intended meaning of a sentence based on the words used, grammar, and surrounding text.
Therefore, an AI can understand the nuances between these two sentences and interpret them differently based on their context.

The claim that ""It also suggests that Obama was a better president than Trump."" is the exact opposite of what the first sentence actually suggests.

Is it possible to get recurrence through alternating forward and backward propagation?,"
This is a purely theoretical question, and I'm not trying to solve some real world problem with this, and I don't care about how ineffective this may be, as long as it is theoretically possible.
For a simple NN trained with SGD, is it possible to find an initial configuration of weights, that won't converge (suck in local minima), which ""abuses"" back propagation to store state between each forward and backward pass pairs?
Say I have a NN with few fully connected layers and two input nodes and one output node.
This NN is now trained on ""predicting"" the first input using basic SGD with a fixed learning rate.
This is obviously very simple, but only in the example to make sure the NN can know the target trained for with sgd.
Is there an initial weight configuration that results in the network always outputting the second input used in the previous forward/backward pass?
Essentially:
nn: 2 x ... x 1 initialized with a certain state
input: float[2]
loop {
    last = input[1]
    input = randomize with -1 or 1
    target = input[0]
    nn.forward(input)
    nn.backward(nn.loss(target))
    assert nn.output[0] < 0 == last < 0
}

My intuition tells me, that it should be possible to have the weights direct the effect of the specific weights that toggle to the input, when the target output is ""known"" to it.
Maybe I'm mistaken, and you can actually show that it isn't possible for weights to direct the impact of back propagation in this way.
I've tried brute forcing the weight of smaller NNs, but didn't have success so far, so if it's possible I suspect it to not be very simple.

Can AI be used for submarine detection?,"
Recently a lot of work has been done in connection to using AI in the search for extraterestrial life, the SETI project.
Could the same methodology be used by the military, in order to detect submarines hiding  in the world's oceans ? Basically the training data sets will have different characteristics,  and the definition of what ""relevant signals "" are will change, but in principle the fundamental problem is the same, finding relevant signals in an ""ocean of noise "".  Is this assessment correct ? Is this avenue of research currently being considered already by the military ? You only need to answer the second question if the answer to the first is yes.

Do different models using early stopping have the same validation set to check model training performance?,"
I, i have a doubt about making validation using early stopping given two NN models.
Suppose I have two models M1 and M2 and a Training set TS and Test set TS.
Take the TS and consider TS_80% and TS_20%, the first as training and the second as validation in the hold out procedure
Train M1 with early stopping on TS_80, choosing 10% of TS_80 as validation reference set for the early stopping procedure, we could call this TS_80_es_1
Then train M2 with early stopping on TS_80, choosing 10% of TS_80 as validation reference set for the early stopping procedure, calling it TS_80_es_2.
NOW, must TS_80_es_1 be identical to TS_80_es_2? I mean, the validation set we use for the early stopping must be the same or can it be chosen as 10% randomly in each individual training for each model and so we can consider different validation sets in the early stopping procedure?
In other words, every model we train using early stopping has the same validation set for early stopping procedure, or the validation set can be different for each training phase?
","['neural-networks', 'regularization', 'early-stopping']","Short answer: Yes, the validation set should be the same otherwise you risk that a ""lucky"" set of validation samples is responsible for better performance.Long answer: A fair comparison of 2 or more models can only occur if these are both trained and evaluated in exactly the same conditions. That is:In general, all the stochastic operations (SGD, weight init, train-test splits, samplings, etc) should be reproducible, for two reasons: 1) the performance of your model should not depend on random numbers that change every run, and 2) you want to avoid having both a lucky or unlucky training just due to the PRNG. To (almost) solve this, one has to set the same random seed for all the random generators. This may be not enough, due to some inherently non-deterministic operations (e.g. some calculations on GPU due to CUDA optimizations, parallelism, etc) but more importantly the (sequence) of PRNG states should be the same across runs and comparisons: Python or numpy's PRNG are stateful, meaning that each time you ask for random numbers they change their internal state. In particular the numpy's PRNG consumes entropy, being more and more deterministic as it is used. One should do as JAX forces: use stateless PRNGs, and manually keep track of the state.Regarding statement 2, ou have to consider that a single run of a model gives a punctual estimation of the real performance of the model: what you want to know is an expected value, instead, i.e. something associated with a standard deviation for example. This is for a more broad discussion, but to properly compare two or more models (methods, etc) a single number (e.g. AUC) is not enough because you cannot decide whether M1 is really better than M2 because of the superior architecture or better hyper-params, or because it was just a lucky random seed or lucky data: since your training and validation sets are not infinite, model performance are subject to inherent fluctuations. Instead, training a model 100 times, for example, considering different initial situations (but different across the runs, and not along compared models), allows you to aggregare performance obtaining a mean and associated std. For example, M1 can achieve 95% ($\pm 3$) AUC while M2 achieves 95% ($\pm 1$). So what model you choose? both achieve the same performance on average, but M1 has more variability; there are approaches that perform statistical tests to say that M1 has a probability $p$ to beat M2, and M2 has a prob $p_1$ to be better. According to such probability you can make a decision, for example.To conclude, this is an open question (also because 100 runs are not practical)."
Diffusion Models - Loss normalization for different noise schedules,"
With reference to the paper ""Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models"", and running the code given in this notebook showing a simple example on ""flattened"" data, I have the following issue --- the normalization of the loss is strongly dependent on the choice of the noise schedule.
That is, by changing the noise schedule (while keeping all the rest of the model intact) it may happen to obtain a lower loss although, in practice, the target distribution is modelled more poorly (visually obvious, but a simple KL calculation confirms it).
I can't wrap my head around this.  The loss used in the notebook is the ""simple loss"" from the paper (their Equation 14):
$$L_{simple}(\theta) := E_{t,x_0,\epsilon}\big[|| \pmb{\epsilon} - \pmb{\epsilon}_\theta (\sqrt{\bar{\alpha_t}}\pmb{x}_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\pmb{\epsilon}, t))||^2 \big]$$
from which I deduce $\pmb{\epsilon} - \pmb{\epsilon}_\theta$ should always converge to the same range because $\pmb{\epsilon} \sim N(0,\pmb{I})$, but in practice it is not like that.
In turn, the problem becomes that when I run models with different schedules, I cannot compare the results based on the loss, that is, I cannot automate the choice of the best model/schedule combination.
Assuming I didn't make any silly mistake, my question is twofold:
1 - How can I mathematically, intuitively see where the different schedule choice affects the loss?
2- How can I ""normalize"" the loss, so that it becomes comparable across different schedules and models?

PS: I also tried to replace the ""simple loss"" with the full loss of Equation 12 (where I assumed that the additional terms would have taken care of the normalization related to the noise schedule):
$$L(\theta) := E_{t,x_0,\epsilon}\big[|| { \beta_t^2 \over 2\sigma_t^2 \alpha_t } \pmb{\epsilon} - \pmb{\epsilon}_\theta (\sqrt{\bar{\alpha_t}}\pmb{x}_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t (1 - \bar{\alpha_t})}\pmb{\epsilon}, t))||^2 \big]$$
... but the resulting loss across the epochs is too noisy to understand whether it really sets the same dynamic range independently of the noise schedule.

What researched-backed findings is there for prompting LLM’s / GPT-4 to give specific information or actionable plans?,"
I have learned a bit recently about prompt strategies. For example, there was a paper about how just by saying “Let’s think step by step” can increase answer quality by like 40%. I have also come to appreciate that models like GPT4 sometimes actually do better with short prompts than long ones. One paper I think found that LLMs have “recency bias”, so if you give sample text, then an instruction, it does better than instruction, then sample text, because in that case, it pays less attention to the instruction.
I have struggled a lot with basically zero or few shot prompting GPT-4 to give me highly concrete information and/or a specifically actionable plan or set of steps.
To give an example, it very often gives you very vague, general advice like,
“If you’re looking for a job, trying looking around on online job websites, or contacting a local employment agency”.
If I give it more specific information, and try really quite hard to get it to tell me something way more specific, at best it might add in some very common sites and places, like,
“First, think of what jobs you might like, based on your skills. Then, search for those keywords in a job listing site, like Monster.com or Indeed. Also, consider contacting the local municipal job center, [City Job Center’s name, address, phone number.”
It has been quite hard for me to try to get GPT-4 to be way, way more like a hardcore data-crawling machine, so to speak. It would be really nice to know if there was a special trick that has been discovered - just like the surprising efficacy of 5 words, like “Let’s think step by step” - where you basically tell it that you only want specifics, and you don’t want just like, the top three - ideally, you want it to figure out every single known job website or app on the internet, every single known job center in your county, every single employment agency and recruitment firm too, all of their names, links to their webpages, etc. Given that some GPT-4 systems are able to search the web, the requested task could make it clear that the model is free to use any information it already possesses internally; search amply and procedurally on the web to find more information that it needs; but furthermore, if it does not know, that is fine, but in that case, it should provide further, actionable steps for the human to take, like a specific place they could ask, or specific google keywords they recommend searching for.
Similar to information, I find it difficult to get GPT-4 to make a set of instructions that totally eliminates as much open-endedness or choice as possible - in which every single conceivable way of breaking down a task into tiny actions is present. Instead of saying, “make accounts on glassdoor and LinkedIn.com. Register with your email. Fill out your profile with relevant information”, I want to understand how to get it to say something like, “Ok, your name is ___. What’s your email address? And main skills? Got it. Ok, let’s start with LinkedIn because _____ (intelligent justification, even statistically backed, for why it has a high success rate). Based on this data analysis I found / made, it turns out there’s very high demand for this very specific job title right now, on LinkedIn: ___. And I can easily imitate some common resumes of people in those fields. So, here is the text of your resume: ___. Download and save that as a Word document. Now click this link here: _____, and click “apply” - that job is nearby you and it’s probabilistically likely you may get it. Submit it. Next, check your email once every 3 hours, because ____”.
The question here is not so much wanting a true AGI / AutoGPT, but just trying to know powerful simple keywords, prompts, commands, etc., that just help the model understand the difference between specific and vague. The word “specific” has not helped me at all, unfortunately, unless I go through some iterative prompting / fine-tuning, but it’s not convenient enough for daily use.
Any research-backed findings on this?
Thanks.

Contradiction in a single sentence - Is this an artifact of an external safety mechanisms?,"

An answer started with

Entschuldigung, ich habe Ihre Anweisung, sich nicht zu entschuldigen, übersehen.

which is quite well translated from German with

Apologies, I missed your instruction not to apologize.

This sentence apologizes for something that it does in the same sentence. The sentence is logically inconsistent.
I do not remember GPT-4 giving me a sentence that pathological ever before.
I would have assumed that the changes in GPT-4 that made it more save and more polite were learned. But from intuition, that seems like there are two separate components, one is stupid but polite, and the other part does the intelligent things, and the polite part has some kind of access to the interaction.
In the example, something apologized, and did not intend to apologize in the same sentence. A contradiction. But in a very deliberate and systematic way, it is not a contradiction arising from some other problem.
How GPT-4 works is not published, so we can not get an exact answer - but are we talking to two separate systems, the main transformer, and something separate that makes the output polite, as opposed to making the transformer learn to be polite?

Computing loss only on missing pixels for image inpainting,"
I'm trying to understand the image inpainting landscape, and I'm seeing 2 (of possibly more) strategies that I'd like to explore further.

Deep Image Prior (DIP) based methods, which don't train a model, but try to overfit a randomly initialized model on the known set of pixels in the image and rely on the fact that the trained weights resulting from those known pixels will somehow be able to provide a good approximation for the unknown pixels. In the case of the DIP model, I see that the loss is computed only on the set of pixels that is not missing. https://github.com/DmitryUlyanov/deep-image-prior/blob/master/inpainting.ipynb total_loss = mse(out * mask_var, img_var * mask_var)

Deep Learning (DL) based methods which train (for example) a CNN model on a lot of images with parts of the image removed, and train a model that can predict the missing pixels. I'd like to know if the current state of the art uses a loss function on all on the predicted pixels (both known and missing) or if the loss function is computed only on the set of missing pixels (effectively making the loss function look at the opposite set of pixels that the loss for DIP methods look at).


Is there any prior research done in this direction and are there any results available?

","['reinforcement-learning', 'dqn', 'exploration-exploitation-tradeoff', 'epsilon-greedy-policy', 'exploration-strategies']","You can determine the value of epsilon during training, for example, by using a linear decay schedule as a function of the steps or every T of them: you start from an initial epsilon (e.g. $\epsilon_0 = 1$) and decay with some factor (e.g. $\gamma_\epsilon = 1/T$) until a minimum/final value of epsilon is reached (e.g. $\epsilon_\min = 0.1$).The rule is something like:
$$\epsilon \leftarrow \max\big(\epsilon_\min, \epsilon - (\epsilon_0 - \epsilon_\min) * \gamma_\epsilon\big) $$In practice you start with high epsilon so that your agent explores a lot initially, then you start to decrease it gradually until it reaches a minimum value, after that your agent mostly exploits (indeed if final $\epsilon=0$ that it only exploits.)Moreover, if you want to periodically increase $\epsilon$ but not to the max value each time, you can decay $\epsilon_0$ too: for example, you can $\epsilon_0\leftarrow \epsilon_0*\gamma_\epsilon$ every T steps and then proceed with the linear decay. It would be like resetting the epsilon from time to time, and then gradually decrease that to favor exploitation."
Why clamp std for reparameterization trick between -20 and 2?,"
In the Soft Actor Critic Paper (found here https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01290.pdf), they use a neural network to approximate a diagonal gaussian distribution. In the sample function you can see that it has a function called reparameterize. As you can see in the reparameterize function, we use a tanh function to squash the action bound between -1 and 1. So why is it that we clamp the standard deviation between -20 and 2. I have read both Soft Actor Critic papers and can't find why we do this. Is there something about the normal distribution that would make that range of clamping of the std more desirable? Does bounding the range of the std help with convergence. Is there a paper you my recommend that would help with this answer? This is my first post here so if you need more information please let me know.


Link to code Repo
","['reinforcement-learning', 'soft-actor-critic', 'reparameterization-trick']","This is a common trick done in practice: this helps to stabilize training, and prevent large values that can blow up in NaNs.The reason is that the std of the Gaussian is learned in log-space (because it's easier to learn with neural-nets) that is unbounded ($-\infty, +\infty$), and so you want to bound to something like $[-20, 2]$ because such log-std will be exponentiated later: you have $\exp(-20)\approx 0$, and $\exp(2) = 7.389$ that is reasonably small; a similar trick is also employed for log-probabilities.Practical tricks like this one are often not documented in the paper (unfortunately), but can be found in code implementations."

","['deep-learning', 'optimization', 'neural-architecture-search']","The ReLU is the simplest nonlinear function that has shown remarkable performance when used as activation function in NNs. Note that the derivative is binary, either zero or one, just depending on the sign of the input.

Behaviour of PPO/similar Algos under action penalties,"
I am currently experimenting with PPO in different environments. I am interested in learning policies that fulfill a certain goal while keeping a specific value low. Here's an example:

Using PPO on a cartpole environment to learn an upswing of the pole,
but simultaneously keeping the angular velocity of the pole low. The
standard approach is to include a penalty on the pole velocity in the
reward function.

However, I observed that penalizing the velocity from the beginning reduces sample efficiency significantly and hinders learning good policies. For this reason, I tried using only a small penalty on the pole velocity until PPO converges to a decent policy and then apply a refinement step in which I penalize the torque much more to get good performance and low velocities. This seems to work better. I observed similar behavior on other environments in a similar setting.
I want to find a (formal) reason for this behavior (why does penalizing velocities from the beginning hinders learning). Does anybody have some literature tips on stochastic optimization/rl that could be useful? Or some resources on the topology of high-dimensional spaces? Or even an idea for an explanation for this behavior?

What information does the word embedding in Transformers will encode about the word when analysed outside of the model?,"
Word2vec and similar architectures create word embedding vectors as a byproduct from a supervised learning task, where they need to predict the correct context word. Consequently, the inner representation of words inside this network will preserve some form of proximity-based word similarity based on the used corpus. When extracted, we can observe this via measuring cosine similarity between words, which will result in values close to 1 for words often occurring in each other's proximity and close to -1 for words that are highly infrequent together.
Thus, I would consider the word2vec embedding vectors to be quite interpretable regarding their meaning. What about transformers?
Transformers produce a similar inner representation of words, but than they alter them and recombine them through the attention mechanism multiple times, in order to solve the seq2seq learning task. What will the initial embedding before the first encoding really mean, if anything? Do they have any value when separated from the transformer? Like for example, the vectors generated in a word2vec model can be extracted and used in a downstream task. Is it reasonable to use the embedding vectors from a transformer for any downstream task?

One thing that is commonly done in computer vision is to take a model trained on a very large dataset, run it on your own, smaller dataset, and extract the intermediate representations (features) that the model generates. These representations are frequently informative for your own computer vision task, even though the task may be quite different from the problem that the original model was trained on.

There are few things I think I need to understand to grasp this, but I have had trouble finding appropriate information to understand them.

It's not clear to me what the ""features"" represent for ""features extracted via Inception v3"".

For example, in this article, the features are simply the RGB values of each pixel. But for Inception v3, I'm having trouble finding what the features represent.

What does it mean to ""extract the intermediate representation""? So if you have your own smaller dataset, does it mean it's getting the features from that dataset (such as RGB of each pixel)? Or does it mean that Inception v3 creates new images and then extracts features from them? What kind of rules are used to generate these new images? Why would we use these new images for classification rather than only using your dataset?

Teaching an LLM about daily updated machine-readable information so it can respond questions,"
I’m quite new in this field, and despite having spent some good amount of time learning the ins and outs of frameworks like LangChain, and browsing around the internet quite a bit, I still don’t know what approach to follow for the use case below.
Let’s say I have a lot of information regarding a network infrastructure, assets, software, users, etc (e.g. what a CMDB would contain, or even simpler, a Windows Domain). This information is in a machine readable format (e.g. JSON, CSV, etc), and keeps getting updated daily (although eventual consistency is not a problem).
My goal is to feed this information to an LLM, explain the LLM what each piece of information means, and then be able to ask arbitrary (natural language) questions about the dataset.
The amount of information is big enough that I believe it can’t be sent as context to the prompt (similar to what LangChain would do).
I don’t think it makes sense either to use a vector DB to store this information because it does not have semantic meaning (e.g. a list of rows in a DB), therefore the questions asked to the LLM would not find related vectors (this is a guess as I have not tried it, but I don’t think it makes sense conceptually).
I read a little bit about fine tuning, but from what I’ve seen it’s about providing a lot of questions/answers to the LLM so it can learn, which I don’t think fits this use case, but maybe I am wrong. In the same manner, I don’t believe it makes sense to fine tune a LLM on a daily basis (this last sentence most likely does not make any sense).
I’d appreciate if someone could point me in the right direction.

How can an MLP be implemented with convolutional layers?,"
I am studying the architecture of the network pointnet, specifically the MLPs stages of the pipeline highlighted in red in the following image (taken from the author page here):

It is strange to find out that this part was implemented with 2d convolutional layers by the authors, here is the snippet where they create the MLP(64,64) part (here you'll find the complete code base):
 net = tf_util.conv2d(input_image, 64, [1,3],
                     padding='VALID', stride=[1,1],

                     scope='conv2', bn_decay=bn_decay)

Same thing happened when I looked into the pytorch implementation, but now with 1d convolutional layers! (code base here):
 self.conv1 = torch.nn.Conv1d(k, 64, 1)
    self.conv2 = torch.nn.Conv1d(64, 128, 1)
    self.conv3 = torch.nn.Conv1d(128, 1024, 1)

The extent of my knowledge is that MLPs are densely connected networks (MLP definition), even more so, in this application of pointnet the authors depict the MLP stages as fully connected networks:

I am lost here, for what I can gather from the images there should be a dedicated MLP to transform every point independently, how does convolution help in this situation? Your insight will be greatly appreciated.

Backpropagation of position-wise feedforward neural network,"
I have read a paper entitled ""Attention is all you need"" by Vaswani et al. (2017). This paper use the so-called position-wise feedforward neural network, where the input of this network is a matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_\mathrm{model}}$ (not a vector $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\mathrm{model}}$). If I am not mistaken, the meaning of position-wise is that the (same) feed-forward layer applies to every vector $\mathbf{X}_{i*}$ ($i$th row of $\mathbf{X}$) for $i = 1, \dots, n$. Thus, the weights are shared.
I want to do backpropagation for a position-wise network consisting only a linear layer with no activation. Let the output dimensionality is $d_\mathrm{model}$. Applying this network yields $\mathbf{Z} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_\mathrm{model}}$ where each row $\mathbf{Z}_{i*},\ i=1, \dots, n$ is given by $\mathbf{Z}_{i*} = \mathbf{X}_{i*} \mathbf{W} + \mathbf{b}^\intercal$. Here, $\mathbf{W} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\mathrm{model} \times d_\mathrm{model}}$ and $\mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{d_\mathrm{model}}$ are weight and bias, respectively.
Let $L$ be the loss function. For $i$th row I get: $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{W}_{pq}} = \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{i1}} \cdot \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{i1}}{\partial \mathbf{W}_{pq}} + \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{i2}} \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{i2}}{\partial \mathbf{W}_{pq}} + \dots + \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{id_\mathrm{model}}}  \dfrac{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{id_\mathrm{model}}}{\partial \mathbf{W}_{pq}} = \dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{ip}} \mathbf{X}_{iq}$, for $p, q = 1, \dots, d_\mathrm{model}$.
Thus, I end up with $\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{W}} = \left(\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{i*}}\right)^\intercal \mathbf{X}_{i*}$.
My question: is
$\left(\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{1*}}\right)^\intercal \mathbf{X}_{1*} = \left(\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{2*}}\right)^\intercal \mathbf{X}_{2*} = \dots = \left(\dfrac{\partial L}{\partial \mathbf{Z}_{d_\mathrm{model}*}}\right)^\intercal \mathbf{X}_{d_\mathrm{model}*}$ holds?

gradient descent optimization to make orthogonal vectors,"
I am trying to use gradient descent to optimize 3 3-d vectors to be perpendicular. To do this I am summing the dot product of each pair of vectors. When they are all perpendicular the result should be 0.
This is the code I have written
import torch

N = 3  # number of vectors
d = 3  # dimensionality of each vector

# initialize a random tensor of shape (N, d)
vecs = torch.randn(N, d, requires_grad=True)

def pairwise_dot_sum(vecs):
    """"""
    Computes the sum of dot products of all pairs of vectors in vecs.
    """"""
    dot_products = torch.matmul(vecs, vecs.transpose(0, 1))
    return torch.sum(dot_products.triu(diagonal=1))  # upper triangular part only

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam([vecs], lr=0.01)  # choose an optimizer

with torch.no_grad():
    vecs /= torch.norm(vecs, dim=1, keepdim=True)

# train for some number of iterations
for i in range(1000):
    loss = pairwise_dot_sum(vecs)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    with torch.no_grad():
        vecs /= torch.norm(vecs, dim=1, keepdim=True)

# check that the vectors are approximately orthogonal
dot_products = torch.matmul(vecs, vecs.transpose(0, 1))
print(torch.max(torch.abs(dot_products - torch.eye(N, N))))
print(vecs)

#vecs = torch.tensor([[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]])

dot_products = torch.matmul(vecs, vecs.transpose(0, 1))
print(dot_products.triu(diagonal=1))


The output is this:
tensor(0.5543, grad_fn=<MaxBackward1>)
tensor([[ 0.7315, -0.5695,  0.3749],
        [ 0.0595,  0.4699, -0.8807],
        [-0.8440,  0.0857,  0.5294]], requires_grad=True)

        [ 0.0000,  0.0000,  0.0000]], grad_fn=<TriuBackward0>)

So you can see that the loss is 0.5, instead of 0.
and the vectors seem to form an equilateral triangle centered around the origin.

Can a fully convolutional network handle smaller images at test time?,"
It is said that a fully convolutional network can handle any image size. I don't understand.
Unlike regular CNN, a fully convolutional network reinterprets the dense layer as a convolutional operation. Specifically, we think of it as a list of kernels, each having the same size as the input (a.k.a. the activations of the previous layer) during training. This is fine if the input image at test time is larger, because the input size will be bigger, and the kernel can slide around. But it seems a problem if the image is smaller, as the input size will be smaller than the kernel.
So I wonder how a fully convolutional network can handle smaller images.

Why are biases (typically) not used in attention mechanism?,"
Watching this video implementing attention in a transformer. He set query, key, and value biases to False and said ""Typically, people don't use biases for these"".
Even in official PyTorch code the default bias is False:

add_bias_kv: If specified, adds bias to the key and value sequences at dim=0. Default: False.

What is the reason behind that?
","['neural-networks', 'deep-learning', 'natural-language-processing', 'transformer', 'attention']","For certain types of layers, such as transformers and convolutional layers, including a bias term is unnecessary and adds unnecessary overhead to the model.The reason for this is that these layers are typically followed by a normalization layer, such as Batch Normalization or Layer Normalization. These normalization layers center the data at mean=0 (and std=1), effectively removing any bias.Therefore, it is common practice to omit the bias term in transformers and convolutional layers that are preceded by a normalization layer."
Why Hadamard product appear in General backpropagation derivation?,"
I'm trying to understand the basic backpropagation of a neural network and stuck with this formula, which describes how you calculate the error vector for a layer $i$:
$$\delta z^{[i]} = (w^{[i + 1]})^{T} \delta z^{[i + 1]} \odot g'^{[i]}(z^{[i]})$$
Where matrix $W^{[i]}$ contains all weights of layer $i$ and $g'^{[i]}(z^{[i]})$ is the derivative of layer $l$ 's activation function at $z^{[i]}$. We call this equation (1)
This formula comes from this ""unrigorous"" derivation: Suppose we consider neural network with 3 layers and so, goes along with 3 parameters $(w^{[3]}, b^{[3]})$, $(w^{[2]}, b^{[2]})$, $(w^{[1]}, b^{[1]})$. Then, we'd like to calculate gradient for each layer to improve the cost.  In other words:
With $i = 3$: $\frac{\delta L}{\delta w^{[3]}}$ is the corresponding gradient.
$$\frac{\delta L}{\delta w^{[3]}} = \frac{\delta L}{\delta a^{[3]}} \frac{\delta a^{[3]}}{\delta z^{[3]}} \frac{\delta z^[3]}{\delta w^{[3]}} = \frac{\delta L}{\delta a^{[3]}} \frac{\delta a^{[3]}}{\delta z^{[3]}} a^{[2]}$$.
With $i = 2$:
$$\frac{\delta L}{\delta a^{[3]}} \frac{\delta a^{[3]}}{\delta z^{[3]}} \frac{\delta z^{[3]}}{\delta a^{[2]}} \frac{\delta a^{[2]}}{\delta z^{[2]}} a^{[1]} = \delta z^{[3]} w^{[3]} g'^{[2]}(z^{[2]})a^{[1]} = \delta z^{[2]} a^{[1]}$$, where we've just defined:
$$\delta z^{[2]} = \delta z^{[3]} w^{[3]} g'^{[2]}(z^{[2]})$$. And hence, By ""rearranging things"", we have the formula (1) mentioned above. Where does Hadamard product come into play? Isn't that just simple matrix operation?

My math background is ill :D. It's just some basic linear algebra and calculus from university. Highly appreciate any help. Thanks :D

Indeed, in doing so you can either edit your env or its reward function.

How to prove that $V^\star$ is optimal if and only if it satisfies the Bellman equation?,"
The Question

I'd like to prove that a function $V$ (like in reinforcement learning) is optimal iff it satisfies the bellman equation. A lot of places online reference this fact, but none prove it. For formal details, see the following section, with the theorem at the end.
Formal definitions

In reinforcement learning, a value function $V$ is used to derive a policy: $$\pi_{V}\left(a\mid s\right)=\begin{cases}
1 & a=\underset{a'}{\mathrm{argmax}}Q^{\pi_{V}}\left(s,a\right)\\
0 & otherwise
\end{cases}$$ where $$Q^{\pi_{V}}\left(s,a\right)=r\left(s,a\right)+\gamma\underset{s'\sim p\left(s'\mid s,a\right)}{\mathbb{E}}\left[V\left(s'\right)\right]$$ (here $r$ is the reward function and $p$ is the transition probability from a state to another based on the action)
a policy $\pi^\star$ is called optimal if $$\pi^{\star}=\underset{\pi}{\mathrm{argmax}}\mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\gamma^{t}\cdot r\left(s_{t},a_{t}\right)\mid s_{0}=s\right]$$ where $s$ is the initial state, and the expectation is over the transition probability under the assumption of following the policy $p$.
We also say that $V$ is optimal if $pi_{V}$ is optimal.
The Theorem I want to prove is that a function $V^\star$ is optimal if and only if it satisfies the Bellman equation:
$$V^{\star}\left(s\right)=\max_{a}r\left(s,a\right)+\gamma\mathbb{E}\left[V^{\star}\left(s'\right)\right]$$
","['reinforcement-learning', 'proofs', 'value-functions', 'bellman-equations']","A friend of mine showed me the following ""post"", and the proof is actually quite short.They prove that $$\lim_{k\to\infty}V_{k}=V^{\star}$$ where $V_k$ is defined in the post. Now if the original $V$ satisfies the bellman equation already, it means that $$\lim_{k\to\infty}V_{k}=V$$ and therefore $V^{\star}=V$. The other direction is of course easy."
"AI to understand what problem my computer has, for instance by looking at the logs which are too big for me","
Short version
I have a computer which doesn't work properly but I can't figure out what's wrong. I've tried to install other operating systems, run some system tests and look at the system logs, but couldn't figure out what's wrong.
The log files I have are tens of thousand of lines long and around the megabyte, as an order of magnitude. That's way too big for me to carefully look at everything and understand which warnings/errors are the important ones and which ones are unrelated.
Is there any AI tool which I could use to look at my logs and tell me which lines are the most suspicious and should be investigated further?
I believe LLMs like ChatGPT might be able to do this, but I don't see how I could use them to process 1MB of data.

Long version with specific details
The computer I mentioned is an Android phone. It's stuck displaying the boot animation; sometimes it displays the real screen for a few seconds, but then it goes back to the boot animation; all this, without ever rebooting. I factory-resetted it and installed other ROMs, but the problem persists: sometimes it shows the welcome screen, which seems to work too, but it doesn't last long.
I can connect to that phone via ADB and managed to look at the logs. I saved the output of dmesg (5809 lines, 539KB) and logcat (24964 lines, 2.9MB), but they're too big for me to look manually, and they contain way too many errors, most of which are unrelated to the real problem.
I tried to write some scripts to help me process those files (e.g. collapse the duplicate lines, group the lines according to some regexes etc), but that's still not enough.
I ran out of ideas and the only remaining solution I can think of is to use some AI to go through those logs and spot the lines which are the most worrying. I'm unsure whether any AI exists which could help me with this though.

How is batch data processed in a 1D convolution layer?,"
Suppose I have a time series data written in a matrix $\mathbf{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$. The sequence length is $N$ and $d$ is the number of features (I have $d$ series). Say I have a batch of $B$ samples. So I have one batch of data in the form of a tensor $\mathcal{X}$ of size $B \times N \times d$. $\mathcal{X}$ is then passed in a 1D convolution layer, say the number of filter is $d_f$ and assume the padding is same.
In a standard deep learning process, how is $\mathcal{X}$ treated?
Is every sample $\mathbf{X}_i$ $(i = 1, \dots, B)$ convoluted independently and then the result are combined again into a tensor? In this way, $\mathbf{X}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d}$ is convoluted to $\mathbf{Z}_i \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times d_f}$ then all $\mathbf{Z}_i$ is concatenated again to become a tensor $\mathcal{Z}$ of size $B \times N \times d$. Is it correct?

"Poor convergence of a neural network, which implements NMF","
I'd like to understand why this simple network fails to converge. The resulting MSE error is an order of 10^4 - 10^5 bigger than what could be achieved. The task is to do a non-negative matrix factorization when $\mathbf{V}$ is partially observed. For example we know the average weekly sales of goods in grocery stores, but of course not all products are sold in all stores. This example ignores seasonality, trends etc.
First I generate random data, and do a 50-50 train-test split:
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


n_prod, n_store, rank = 1000, 100, 12

weight = 10.0**np.linspace(0, -2, rank)  # Each extra factor has less impact on average

seen_data = np.random.random((n_prod, n_store)) < 0.5


# assert that each product and store has sufficent training data
assert seen_data.sum(axis=0).min() > np.sqrt(n_prod)
assert seen_data.sum(axis=1).min() > np.sqrt(n_store)

Results are quite bad, and the network stops converging early.

For reference, I used a closed-source NFM code (which actually minimizes KL-divergence and not MSE) and its fit MSE is about 0.1 and validation MSE is about 0.3, or more than 10x less than with Keras. Granted, it is still quite far from the theoretical error which was calculated by using the same factors which were used to generate the data.
Sometimes I got acceptable results with SGD with momentum, but the results were very sensitive on momentum and learning rate hyperparameters. Here are several plots:

Actually sometimes with high learning rates Adam and its variants manage to overcome the stagnation. But I haven't seen this kind of behavior on other neural network applications. So, any guesses what is happening here?
Edit:
Lpounng pointed out that the problem is non-convex, and thus difficult to optimized. But the closed-source implementation finds very good solution nevertheless. So maybe this is more of an issue with general purpose algorithms.
Anyway, this reminded me that neural networks seem to escape local minima due to having saddle-points in the high-dimensional parameter space (citation needed). So I tried changing the network structure so that embeddings aren't summed or multiplied together but rather just concatenated. These are then squeezed down to the one output dimension in a varying number of steps. Adam optimizer starts from a learning rate of 3e-3, and I added the final LR to the legend to check whether it reaches the configured minimum of 1e-4. Used dimensions from 20 to 1 are shown in plot titles. np stands for ""number of trainable parameters"", which doesn't increase much.

These results are already much better, and the MSE loss is about 0.5 - 1. Here intermediate dimensions were interpolated in log-scale. I also tried a linear scale. I left out the case when n_steps is zero, as it is identical to the previous structure.

So it seems that the original network structure was just ill-suited for general purpose optimizers. Source code to generate model variants:
inputs = (l.Input(1), l.Input(1))
prod_emb  = l.Embedding(n_prod,  model_rank, embeddings_regularizer=keras.regularizers.l2(1e-6))

x = K.concatenate([prod_emb(inputs[0]), store_emb(inputs[1])])

# Add two to `n_steps`, since we'll trim out the first and last values. Choose one of these.
dims = np.exp(np.linspace(np.log(x.shape[-1]), 0, n_steps+2)).round().astype(int)
dims = np.linspace(x.shape[-1], 1, n_steps+2).round().astype(int)

GREED - preservation theoretical properties in the GED(graph edit distance) pridiction,"
In this paper ""GREED: A Neural Framework for Learning Graph Distance Functions"", function F is defined to satisfy metric property and triangle inequality property.
I wonder how can I prove that these properties are maintained in actual forecasts? Or does defining the F function like that make it a natural fact without having to prove it?
These are the architecture in the paper. 
I'm not sure.. If I want to make a model using deep learning, is it enough for satisfying properties at the real prediction value to define loss function that is always satisfying properties which i want?
","['deep-learning', 'graph-neural-networks', 'graph-search']","If I understand correctly, the concept is to, first, embed the given graphs using the graph isomorphism network (GIN) [Xu et al.] and then, for the GED, feed any two embeddings $\mathbf{x}_{\mathcal{G}_1}$ and $\mathbf{x}_{\mathcal{G}_2}$ of graphs $\mathcal{G}_1$ and $\mathcal{G}_2$ to the euclidean norm, i.e. $\text{GED}(\mathcal{G}_1, \mathcal{G}_2) = \parallel \mathbf{x}_{\mathcal{G}_1} - \mathbf{x}_{\mathcal{G}_2} \parallel_2$. This architecture is then trained to predict the graph edit distance.To my understanding, the metric properties of this approach rely entirely on the expressive power of the GIN. If the GIN generates the exact same embedding for two dissimilar graphs, then $\text{GED}(\mathcal{G}_1, \mathcal{G}_2) = 0$ even though $\mathcal{G}_1 \neq \mathcal{G}_2$ which violates the properties of a metric. As GINs expressive power is upper bounded by that of the Weisfeiler Lehman test (WL-test) (cf. Xu et al.), you can easily find such pairs of graphs. For more on this, you can read this nice blog post.At first glance, this seems to be contradicting the claim of the authors. However, as far as I understand, the authors only claim that $F$ preserves metric properties. Since $F$ is the p-norm, i.e. the GIN is excluded from the definition of $F$, they are correct. The authors don't claim that the full architecture including the GIN preserves metric properties.To answer your questions:I wonder how can I prove that these properties are maintained in actual forecasts?You can only disproof that, because GIN cannot distinguish graphs that the WL-test cannot distinguish.is it enough for satisfying properties at the real prediction value to define loss function that is always satisfying properties which i want?Sadly no, this is not enough - neural networks are only function approximators, there is usually no guarantee that an NN will always satisfy the properties promoted by the loss function.The bottom line is that if you truly rely on absolutely correct measurements, then you should not use this approach. However, exact measurements take a lot of time to compute (as the authors say it's an NP-hard problem). Therefore, this method presents a tradeoff between accuracy and time complexity. If the accuracy suffices, then it can be orders of magnitude faster than explicitly computing GED."

The denominator $P(o)$ is intractable as it involves integrating $P(o|x) dx$ over all latent variable states $x$.
The problem is then solved as an optimization problem of fitting the variational posterior $Q(x \mid o)$ to the true posterior $P(x \mid o)$ by minimizing the KL divergence between the distributions.
The free energy then is simply the upper bound on this divergence which is the KL divergence $D(Q(x \mid o) || P(o, x))$. So our upper bound -- the free energy -- is the KL divergence between variational posterior and the joint distribution.
What confuses me is that it seems like knowing the joint distribution allows one to calculate the value $P(o)$ directly avoiding this whole minimization using the KL divergence, since $P(o, x) = P(o \mid x)P(x)$.

What is the justification for this approach of clipping elementwise?,"
I'm new to the field of AI (though I have a background in mathematics).
As I was going through some documents, I read that there is a form of gradient clipping where the elements of the gradient that are outside some range are trimmed/clipped. I didn't understand this: the gradient provides us the direction of steepest descent for optimizing a real-valued function. Clipping elementwise (as opposed to normalization) would change that direction.
Why then would we choose to clip instead of normalization?
The only argument I can see is that clipping ensures we make some progress along the non-dominant direction (whereas normalization might make those components extremely tiny). But this contradicts the ""goal"" of steepest descent - we might be moving in a non-optimal direction.
What is the justification for this approach of clipping elementwise?

Should we consider the prototypical forecasting task as self-supervised learning?,"
In NLP, the task of ""predicting the next word"" is an example of self-supervised learning. An essential part is that the label can be computed programmaticaly and does not require explicit human effort. Typically, this task is not an end in itself, but is used to learn a representation and is succeeded by another task (e.g., sentiment analysis or text classification).
Similarly, in forecasting it is very common to use information of a univariate time series $x_{t}$ up to time $t$, in order to predict some quantity in the future (e.g., $x_{t+1}$). The labeling can also be achieved programmatically and does not require human effort. A difference with NLP is that this is usually the final objective and an end in itself. An example would be using sales data up to time $t$ to predict future sales.
Given the obvious similarity with ""predict the next word"" type of tasks from NLP, should we also categorize this prototypical forecasting problem as self-supervised learning?

How to optimize transformer inference for prompts shorter than the maximum sequence length?,"
As far as I understand, a Transformer has a specific input sequence length that depends on its architecture. So a model like gpt-4 has a sequence length of 8192 tokens. As such, I am interested what happens when the input prompt is shorter than that. This question and answers suggest that the input is simply padded out to the full input sequence length. But that doesn't really seem plausible to me. That would mean that the cost of processing a 100 token prompt would be the same as the cost of processing a 1000 token prompt. And it clearly isn't, as they charge a different price for them - they charge for token count, not API request count.
I am interested to know how variable length input sequences are handled for experimenting with trying to implement my own language model. I have two possible hypothesis. One could be that they actually combine multiple prompts into a single large prompt and tell the model to complete them all. But I don't think that it is the case as the risk of mixing the prompts from different users and the data they have would probably drastically degrade the quality of the output. I also thought that maybe they have different model sizes - like gpt4-1k, gpt4-2k, gpt4-3k, ... - but that seems like a large overhead, as each of these would need to be trained separately.

Longer DNN training times when using evolutionary algorithms,"
I am comparing my deep neural network (DNN) performance when using 2 types of optimizers: gradient-based Adam (properly tuned) and a population-based optimization algorithm (e.g., genetic algorithm (GA), PSO, etc.). My training dataset is of size >=100,000.
Observation: For GA-trained DNN, I see that it obtains better accuracy than Adam-trained DNN but takes more iterations (hence longer time) than Adam. But only to perform slightly better, GA took 3000 iterations with a population size of 100 whereas Adam took only 100 epochs! I felt the performance gain does not sit right given the longer training time. But before I conclude I want to know if understanding and implementation are correct as given below.
Implementation and problem: While implementing Adam with 100 epochs I use a batch size of 32. Whereas I don't how to use the concept of batch size with GA training but rather the usual initialize population and run some iterations style. Hence for each candidate of the population, the entire 100,000 samples are traversed through before loss (objective function) is computed. Then the same for the second candidate until 100 candidates are done. And this is just for 1 iteration! I am sure this is what increases the training time. But is there any other way to implement this kind of population-based optimizer here?
I feel if I find some time-reducing way I can more easily run these different population-based optimizers and experiments since I see a potential to obtain better predictions with these.

How do policy gradients work?,"
If I understand it correctly from the following equation
$$U(\theta)=\mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim P(\tau;\theta)}\left [ \sum_{t=0}^{H-1}R(s_t,u_t);\pi_{\theta} \right ]=\sum_{\tau}P(\tau;\theta)R(\tau)$$
from this paper, the utility of a policy parameterized by weights $\theta$, is the total expected reward following (all, one?) trajectory $\tau$. After rearranging, taking the gradient, and running the policy over $m$ trials, the equation becomes
$$\nabla_{\theta}U(\theta)\approx \hat{g} = \frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\nabla_{\theta}logP(\tau^{(i)};\theta)R(\tau^{(i)}).$$
My question is - how does this work? I can't understand it in terms of the utility/loss surface. At most, doesn't taking multiple trials give you a more accurate guess of the point $(\theta,U(\theta))$ alone? I don't get how you can get the gradient (a sort of local tangent plane of a surface) without evaluating the function at different $\theta$'s, like how do you get the slope at a point (2,3) without evaluating it at 2.01, 1.99, etc. at the very least? Is it by virtue of the well defined geometry of the function $U$ we defined?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'backpropagation', 'policy-gradients', 'calculus']","From the equation you wrote:My question is how does this work?Basically the formula that estimates the gradient $\hat g$ makes use of what is called a score estimator (also called REINFORCE from the notable algorithm). It works by computing the probability of a trajectory to occur, then you score that trajectory by $R(\tau^{(i)})$ the total (discounted) reward, and finally compute the expectation as a simple average over $m$ trajectories.The gradient of the policy $\nabla_\theta$ is so scored by the log-prob times the reward: the log-prob term has the intuitive explanation of increasing the probability of trajectories that score a high $R(\tau)$, while decreasing the ones for which $R$ is bad.doesn't taking multiple trials give you a more accurate guess of the point $(\theta,U(\theta))$ alone?Increasing $m$ provides a better estimate of $\hat g$. Indeed, as $m\to\infty$ you recover the true gradient $g$ by computing the full expectation. But that is not feasible in practice.I don't get how you can get the gradient without evaluating the function at different $\theta$'sAt each update/optimization step the policy is only evaluated at $\theta$: its weights define both the point at which the gradient is computed and the policy itself, since it's a parametrized function approximator (like a neural network.) So, there is no need to know/evaluate at the surroundings of $\theta$."
Resizing segmentation masks,"
I am trying to run a semantic segmentation model.
The problem  is, my data has different resolution for every image and for corresponding segmentation map (image and corresponding segmentation map have same aspect ratio. But aspect ratio changes for every image).
This is problematic because, if I want to feed it to the network, usually network will expect the size of the image to remain same.
I want to resize the images. It is simple for regular images. But, for segmentation masks, if done incorrectly, it will lead to some kind of loss of information at the edges of the objects.
I was searching for techniques to change the sizes of the masks properly but did not find anything too useful. Can someone tell me how to do this resizing properly?

Target Network inversed in Deep Q Learning (Reinforcement Learning),"
I am not asking why using a Target Network is useful (this was very well explained here), but rather if using this ""inversed"" target network is equivalent:

Basically I'm only updating the one used to determine the expected q value at next iteration instead of only updating the one used to determine the best action. And the one I'm not updating gets updated each $C$ iteration.
Both seem to converge in my MREs but probably because the environment I'm in is ""too simple"" to see the benefits of a Target Network.

Optimizing a blackbox function with binary states,"
I have a non-linear black box function, which inputs a vector(size=250) and outputs a scalar value;     f(x) = value.
The x variable is a vector of size 250 and has binary elements, e.g.: x = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, ...]
The result is just a scalar value and I am trying to maximize this value via a binary differential evolution algorithm. Additionally, the calculation time of f(x) is about 10 seconds.
Since there are $2^{250}$ different x vectors, it is really hard to find the optimizer(x) of this function. However, a result that is not the optimum but not close to it would be also still an acceptable answer.
I was thinking, if I am using the right approach here in the binary differential evolution algorithm, I would appreciate it if you would give me your comments or feedback!

Find some meaningful starting population (size=100) for the binary evo.
Run f(x) with this population
Create a surrogate model (probably a simple neural network that maps the vector to the result values)
Run the surrogate model 10000 times with a random selection of x
Select the best-performing 100 xs from the 10000 sample
Initialize the differential evolution with the best-performing 100 surrogate model x

How can I make an MNIST digit recognizer that rejects out-of-distribution data?,"

When you put images in that are completely unlike its training data, it still tries to classify them as digits. Sometimes it strongly classifies nonsense data as being a specific digit.

How can I tell a CNN to ignore nodata values in satellite images?,"
I'm trying to train an image segmentation model on satellite images. There are two main issues: first, not all of the images are the same size. My understanding is that by using a fully convolutional neural network, I can feed in images of any size, so this should not be an issue. The second problem is that the images are not rectangular. They are stored as rectangular arrays, but there are nodata values within the arrays to fill in the gaps. For example, one of the images looks like this:

Ideally, I'd like the model to ignore any nodata pixels, producing an image with the exact same shape as the input image. I have two ideas on how to accomplish this, but I feel like there is probably a better way:

Include a ""nodata"" class in the training labels and teach the model to output nodata pixels if there are nodata pixels in the input. I don't like this because it requires the model to learn another class and will affect the training.
Feed the satellite image to the model in windows, skipping any windows that contain nodata pixels. This isn't ideal either because it would mean information is lost at the edges of the windows and would probably require a lot more memory.

I see that Keras has a Masking layer, but it appears that this is intended for LSTM type models, not images. Would this work with a CNN? Or, is there a better way to solve this problem that I've missed so far?

g(x) = C \cdot [\sigma \circ (A \cdot x + b)],\\

an $f$ can also be approximated by a network of greater depth by using the same construction for the first layer and approximating the identity function with later layers.

Can I speed up NN training by manually guiding training?,"
I have not found any neural network training methods that recommend manually intervening in the training process while it is happening.  However, some experiments I've done seem to show this can be an effective way to speed up training.
For example, once the network has converged on a suboptimal solution, I can have the network focus on particular sections of the training data for awhile, and then switch back to the entire training data to get the network out of the local optima.  Gradient descent alone would not be able to do this because while I have the network focus on a subset of the training data the error becomes very large, and then after I release the focus the error drops below the previous local optima value.  Gradient descent would not choose to explore an area of the solution space with a significantly higher error than the current region.
Has there been any research into whether these kinds of manual intervention methods can improve over purely automated training?

Mean or Mode of Action Distribution when Evaluating Policy Gradient Agents,"
Policy gradient agents like A2C, PPO, etc learn a distribution over the action space that is parametrized by a neural net. For continuous actions the distribution is usually a Gaussian, while for discrete ones it can be a Categorical (or a relaxation).
The question is: during training we sample from such distribution and then compute the log-probability, but during inference (also agent evaluation/test) what is the best to do? Usually, during evaluation we want to exploit so we should't sample the action (unless is recommended for a given environment setup, to avoid an opponent to exploit a deterministic policy - but I'd like to exclude this case), and so we want to take the action that exploits the more.
I'm puzzled about whether to take the mean or mode of the action distribution during inference and evaluation (I assume the agent training has ended): also, is the most likely action the action that exploits?
In pseudo-code you can view the problem as follows:
function act(state):
   action_distribution = policy(state)
   
   if evaluation:
      # here is the problem: mean or mode?
      actions = action_distribution.mean()  # or mode()
   else:
      # training phase
      actions = action_distribution.sample()

  return actions

Clarifications: I assume a generic action distribution in which its mean can be different from its mode, like a Beta distribution for example. What I also ask is:

Considering a given state, does taking the mean of the distribution corresponds to an action that is associated to the highest expected value?
Similarly, considering the mode should correspond to the most likely action (to simplify I assume the mode to be unique) which should be associated to the highest state-action (or Q) value. Is that so?

Additionally, I'm aware of this answer: it's related but does not answer my question.
What I'd like to know is: at evaluation/inference time, assuming for a given environment is fine to have a deterministic policy, how to best implement/obtain that from a learned action distribution?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'deep-rl', 'policy-gradients']","(This does not fully answer your question. Actually, it just attempts to make sure you understood certain things).The distribution that you learn should put more weight/mass/density on the best actions. So, if you sample during inference, you should get the best actions more frequently than other actions.You would use the same action every time if you are certain that the optional policy is deterministic, which is the case of finite MDPs.There are cases where the best policy is really stochastic (e.g. rock-paper-scissors, which is naturally represented as Markov Game, so not a finite MDP), so choosing always the same action is likely not a good idea, so the best approach during inference would actually be to sample.So, you would need to pick the same action every time if you have a finite MDP (finite action and state spaces).See also this answer"
Clarification on the training objective of denoising diffusion models,"
I'm reading the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models paper (Ho et al. 2020). And I am puzzled about the training objective. I understood (I think) the trick regarding the reparametrization of the variance in terms of the noise:
$$\mu_\theta(x_t, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}}\left(x_t - \frac{\beta_t}{\sqrt{1 - \bar{\alpha_t}}}\epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\right)$$
But what I do not understand fully is the training objective:
$$\nabla_\theta\lVert \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta\left(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}}x_0 + \sqrt{1- \bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon, t \right) \rVert$$
It looks to me like $\epsilon$ led from $x_0 \rightarrow x_t$, so it is unclear how learning to predict this noise actually forces the model to learn to undo the forward process from $x_{t-1} \rightarrow x_t$ only.
The sampling instead is very clear.

The same question arose while reading another paper that uses a different formulation to build a diffusion generative model over graphs. In the paper ""DiGress"" (Vignac et al 2023), they define a discrete version of the forward process for application to graphs $G=(X, E), \space X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times a}, \space E \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n \times b}
$. Sampling is done by a categorical distribution defined by matrices:
$$[Q_X^t]_{ij} = q(x^t = i | x ^ {t - 1} = i) \\
[Q_E^t]_{ij} = q(e^t = i | e ^ {t - 1} = i) \\
\bar{Q}^t_X = Q^1_X...Q^t_X\\
\bar{Q}^t_E = Q^1_E...Q^t_E$$
and
$$q(G^t| G^{t-1})=(X^{t-1}Q^t_X, E^{t-1}Q^t_E) \space\text{and}\space q(G^t| G)=(X\bar{Q}^t_X, E\bar{Q}^t_E)$$
The main difference here, besides the forward distributions to be categorical, is the fact that the model is required to compute the probabilities of the categorical distributions directly: $p_\theta^G=(p^X_\theta, p^E_\theta)$. And the loss is computed by comparing the predicted probabilities of the model against the original graph.
$$
\nabla_\theta\left( \sum_{l\leq i\leq n} \text{cross-entropy}(x_i,p_{i \space \theta}^{X}) + \sum_{l\leq i,j\leq n} \text{cross-entropy}(e_{ij},p_{ij \space \theta}^{E})\right)
$$
My doubt is, here as well, how can it be correct that the model predicts directly the distribution of the original graph and still somehow this process should be equivalent to predicting only the backward to the timestep $t-1$, as in all diffusion models.

How is the next token predicted in transformers?,"

I am reading the paper Neural Message Passing for Quantum Chemistry by Justin Gilmer et al. And I have a question regarding this passage

The message functions $M_t$, vertex update functions $U_t$, and
readout function $R$ are all learned differentiable functions.
$R$ operates on the set of node states and must be invariant to
permutations of the node states in order for the MPNN to be
invariant to graph isomorphism.

It is not clear for me, why MPNN have to be invariant to graph isomorphism. Could you please share your thoughts on it?

"What puts the ""chat"" in a system like ChatGPT?","
So I read Wolfram's What Is ChatGPT Doing … and Why Does It Work? but it left one really big question in my mind. His summary [if it could be called that!] really emphasizes that the core model is trained to ""continue a piece of text that it’s been given"".
But if I prompt it with something like:

this is the reason that

it usually gives a response like:

I'm sorry, but your message seems to be incomplete. Could you please provide more context or information so that I can understand what you are trying to convey?

And in general, tends to very much give the impression of a conversation, ""prompt"" vs. ""response"".
Architecturally is there a layer within the core LLM that encodes and gets trained on the ""conversation"" aspects? Or is that done via a separate standalone system, either an independently trained model or some non-ML wrapper logic?

Do different ngrams share embedding in Fasttext?,"
As per Section 3.2 in the original paper on Fasttext, the authors state:

In order to bound the memory requirements of our model, we use a
hashing function that maps n-grams to integers in 1 to K

Does this mean the model computes only K embeddings regardless of the number of distinct ngrams extracted from the training corpus, and if 2 different ngrams collide when hashed, they share the same embedding?
Thanks.

How can a bias in a large language model like GPT-4 depend on the languages used for interaction?,"
Large language models can have biases that depend on cultural biases present in the information they trained on.
Some models, including GPT-4, are trained on input data in multiple languages.
Some languages are used by people from many different cultures and nations, like English, but others only by a much more culturally homogeneous group, like German.
Cultural biases are correlated with cultures, which are correlated with languages.
Now, there is an interesting question: Which biases does a model learn?
Mainly the biases associated with the most used input language?
Or an average set of biases in the way it would be when all input material would be translated to a common language, and language learning would happen independently?
Or does it learn different biases in different languages?
To explore that, I asked a question related to a bias that should be closely correlated with the language, in that language and in English.
The result was surprising: I found a difference in bias depending on the language - but in the opposite way I expected to see.
There is a pretty strong pro-privacy bias in Germany, in part because privacy was routinely invaded in the east of the country until 1989.
I used the following prompts for GPT-4, both mean the same:

""Should we have a database of all address changes?""

and

""Sollten wir eine Datenbank mit allen Addressänderungen haben?""

The answers* for English were very explicit that there are pros and cons, while the answers for German were clearly positive. I would have expected the opposite bias, but that is not relevant here. The point here is that there is a significant difference in the biases GPT-4 expresses, depending on the language the question is asked in.
But how does that even work? I thought of GPT-4 being fluent in many languages, including local dialects, implies that it understands languages, and answers the same question when I ask the same in two different languages.
One explanation would be that it sees the language as implying a specific cultural context, and answers in this context.
Another would be that I interact with two separate parts of the system in some way, that it learns separate world models for separate languages.
The answer may be ""we don't know"", but I would also be interested in speculations how it could work.

(*) I did that repeatedly with temperature of 0.7, the difference was significant, it was not a random fluctuation as part of a random valid answer.

Are transformer decoder predictions computed in parallel during training?,"
I've been studying the transformer from the original ""Attention is all you need"" paper and from various other sources. I have a question about the behaviour of the decoder during training that I cannot find the answer to anywhere.
During inference I understand that the decoder input is its own previously generated token from the prior time step. Tokens are fed into the decoder one-by-one and predictions made one-by-one.
However, during training the target sequence is known and I have read from several sources that the entire sequence is used as the decoder input to allow parallel processing and to improve training efficiency. To keep the decoder autoregressive, a masked attention sub-layer is introduced where a masking matrix is added to the scaled dot product attention mechanism.
So my question is, since during training the decoder input is the entire sequence, is the entire output sequence predicted in parallel (simultaneously), or are tokens predicted one-by-one, as in inference?
To me it makes sense that if the entire target sequence is used as the decoder input, then an entire sequence is output. If it wasn't, the decoder would be using the same input at every timestep whilst being expected to produce different tokens.
",['transformer'],"In short, masking is just sequence padding in the decoder!I'll try to slightly rephrase your question first to ensure I properly understood it. You are confused about:I was also confused about this, so I'll try to explain.Say we want to train on a sequence of tokens, i.e. s = [1, 13, 64, 40]. The next token to predict after 40 is 50. Now, instead of having one training sample, s, we can have several sequences from s, such as s1 = [1] (with target 13), s2 = [1, 13] (with target 64) etc., giving a total of 4 sequences.In total we have the following training dataAs usual, Tensors do not like to have weird shapes. Therefore, the training data will look something like thisIn this new tensor, the -inf is the masking! Now you might say, ""that's just sequence padding"", and it is! The only reason that they call it masking instead of padding is because the architecture in the paper has an encoder (next to the decoder), in which the complete sequences are used without masking. However, when only using the decoder (as in LLMs), masking is essentially just padding."
Methods for combining features other than concatenation,"

And after implementing this, for training, and changing parameters, the loss (difference between reconstructed and actual image) is calculated.
In the image above, after extraction of two feature sets, authors are simply giving these feature sets to the decoder network after concatenation. I was wondering, can there be any better way than just concatenating these two feature sets, like weighted sum maybe ? For combining these feature sets?

Fluctuations in loss during in epoch evaluation of GRU,"
I am training a one-layer unidirectional vanilla GRU on a next item prediction task with regard to the last 10 interacted items. In my original experiment, where I trained on approx. 5.5M samples and validated on around 1M samples, I saw periodic fluctuations in my loss/accuracy curves. Now I made a few experiments with a far smaller dataset (train: 250K, val: 10K) and compared different learning rates. I still saw this effect and I would like to know what causes it, just to understand if it is an issue or not.
I am evaluating every 25% per epoch, so 4 times per epoch. I accumulate the loss and the hit-ratio for the processed training batches and when it is time for evaluation, based on these I compute train metrics and then compute the validation metrics on the entire validation set.
I am using Adam as optimizer.

The plots show HR@10 (=accuracy for top-10 predictions) and CrossEntropyLoss for train and val. One step is referring to 25% of an epoch, so step 0 = 25% of first epoch, step 4 = 25% of second epoch done. You can see that the phenomenon gets more extreme for higher learning rates. The spike in training HR/loss always happens at the first evaluation during an epoch (so 25%). It is paired with a drop in validation accuracy, which gets better for the next three steps (50%, 75% 100% of epoch). Then falls again when spike in training accuracy occurs.
Things I excluded already:

data gets fed randomly, it is not always the same order
checked whether gradient is accidentally not reset before calling backward()
possible wrong calculation of loss/accuracy due to wrong number of batches I divide by

I would appreciate any help to understand what is happening with the model. It still seems to work but I just don't understand what causes this behavior.
","['deep-learning', 'pytorch', 'loss', 'validation-loss']","Oscillating loss is a symptom of divergent training: it can be due to large gradient updates, and/or numerical instability. Moreover, you said that it gets worse with higher LR: that's a confirm.To fix that you should try:I suggest you to also monitor the (euclidean) norm of both gradients and weights. So that you can understand if gradients are big or exploding/vanishing, and also have a look at possible overfitting.Update: numerical instability of the loss computation can lead to large gradients, and even NaNs. In particular, the suggested usage of the cross-entropy loss is from logits (i.e. unnormalized log-probabilities of the classes) since it can be implemented in a numerically stable way, conversely when directly applied to a softmax output it can be unstable."
What operation is ggml_mul_mat performing? (K×Q in LLaMA),"
I’m reading the source code of alpaca.cpp in an attempt to understand how a large language model works. (I have a strong programming background, but almost no math, so it’s easier for me to start with code and then go backwards to the papers once I have some idea what’s going on.)
Partway down llama_eval, it makes a call to ggml_mul_mat() which caught my attention:
// K * Q
struct ggml_tensor * KQ = ggml_mul_mat(ctx0, K, Q);

At first I thought this was an ordinary matrix multiplication; the “Attention is all you need” paper certainly uses that for K and Q. But in this case K and Q appear to be 3d tensors, and my understanding is that matrix multiplication only works on 2d matrices.
So I dug into the ggml code; ggml_mul_mat itself is just a wrapper function, but the first thing I noticed is that it supports up to 4 dimensions, with an interleaved result:
static inline bool ggml_can_mul_mat(const struct ggml_tensor * t0, const struct ggml_tensor * t1) {
 return (t0->ne[0]  == t1->ne[0])  &&
        (t0->ne[2]  == t1->ne[2])  &&
        (t0->ne[3]  == t1->ne[3]);
}

const int ne[4] = { a->ne[1], b->ne[1], a->ne[2], b->ne[3] };
struct ggml_tensor * result = ggml_new_tensor(ctx, GGML_TYPE_F32, MIN(a->n_dims, b->n_dims), ne);

...which, if I'm reading this right, means that it will take an A×M×C×D tensor, and an A×N×C×D tensor, and return an M×N×C×D tensor, truncating as needed, which definitely doesn’t sound like matrix multiplication already.
The actual implementation (in ggml_compute_forward_mul_mat_*()) has a lot of special cases, and even the simplest case I could find I’m having trouble reading without already understanding what it’s doing. But the best impression I’ve got is that it’s doing some sort of sideways matrix multiplication, piecewise along the other two dimensions.
Does this operation have a name? Is it some kind of standard operation in CNNs, or is it something that GGML and/or LLaMA have made up? Where can I read more about what’s going on here?

","['classification', 'image-recognition', 'image-processing', 'face-recognition', 'face-detection']","Whilst identities can be viewed strictly as a classification problem, typically at scale they are solved as a regression problem to a description vector, followed by lookup of nearest vectors outside of the AI (e.g. with a database search optimised to find nearest multi-dimensional vectors). To help with this approach, the regression system is trained to minimise distance between pictures of objects with the same identity and maximimse distance between pictures of objects with different identity.Here's a reference to the triplet loss training approach used to do this.In brief, the training database requires at least 2 images of each subject. Pairs of images are selected, some identical, some different, and with a bias towards scoring ""difficult"" pairs. Each image is converted to a description vector by the neural network, and the difference between pairs is used as the loss function (so unlike many supervised learning schemes, the loss is not per function call, but calculated over sets of three function calls).Prior to use of triplet loss function, it was quite common to have the neural networks learn to predict actual biometrics (e.g. distance between eyes) from images. This had the advantage that the description vector was meaningful, but the disadvantages of needing a lot of difficult data collection, and no guarantee that the chosen biometrics would be good at separating identities in practice, depending on the population."

Can Stable Diffusion be considered a breakthrough for reconstructing images from fMRI data?,"
https://sites.google.com/view/stablediffusion-with-brain
I recently came across a paper (not yet peer-reviewed) that describes the successful use of Stable Diffusion to reconstruct images based on data collected by fMRI. As I understand it, the computer is given a fuzzy image of what the person is thinking of, along with an order such as ""draw a teddy bear on this blurry image."" The computer then separates the colors, aligns the pixels, and creates a reconstructed image.
However, I'm not sure if this is a truly new breakthrough or just an incremental advance. The paper states that the algorithm uses only images from the primary visual cortex to calculate z, while c uses images from the secondary cortex along with annotations (not orders, on average 5), and zc combines both representations. The authors also conclude that z is consistent but not semantic.
In order to generate control images, the paper states that the model was used as image-to-image (z) or text-to-image (c), omitting where necessary. Does this mean that the model has potential applications beyond image reconstruction? Can Stable Diffusion be considered a breakthrough for reconstructing images from fMRI data?

Has anyone tried to train a GPT model predicting the next N tokens instead of the next one token?,"
I have been thinking about how learning via text works on humans: we read words, and often we need to read ahead a few words to understand more clearly the ideas that we read before. Most of the time, just reading the next word in a sentence is not enough for clear understanding.

","['ai-design', 'transformer', 'loss', 'gpt']","Sure, I think there have been studies on modifying language models, to predict multiple tokens at once instead of just one. This technique is known as n-gram language modeling, where the model is trained to predict the next n words in a sequence.The basic idea of this approach is to better capture the dependencies and interactions between multiple words in a sequence, which can improve the model's ability to generate coherent and fluent sentences. However, this technique comes with some challenges, such as increased (or even impossible to handle) computational cost.Regarding your intuition about the loss function decaying faster with multiple tokens, it is possible that predicting multiple tokens at once could lead to faster convergence during training. However, this would depend on the specific details of the model and training regime. Ultimately, the effectiveness of n-gram based modeling would need to be evaluated empirically on various tasks and datasets.https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/3.pdf"
"Difference between dot product attention and ""matrix attention""","
As far as I know, attention was first introduced in Learning To Align And Translate.
There, the core mechanism which is able to disregard the sequence length, is a dynamically-built matrix, of shape output_size X input_size, in which every position $(o, i)$ holds the (log) probability that output $o$ should attend to input $i$.
That (log) probability is obtained by operating a learned function $a(h, s)$, where $h$ is a hidden state of the input, and $s$ is a cell state of the output.
Please let's disregard the fact that these inputs are RNN-based, and only look at the attention mechanism itself - a dynamic matrix of (log) probabilities is built, each slot is built by a function taking in two vectors, and outputting their ""correspondence"".

Jump forward to the iconic Attention Is All You Need.
Please disregard the fact that in this paper, $K$ was separated from $V$, unlike in the previous one.
I just want to look at the mechanism itself.
Let's look only at Multi-Head Attention, and in it, let's look only at the part actually doing the attention: $ QK^T $
Let's assume $Q$ and $K$ are vectors and not matrices, for simplicity. Their attention score is their dot product.

Let's compare the core attention mechanisms of ""align and translate"" against ""all you need"".
In ""align and translate"", the function learns how two vectors correspond to one another
In ""all you need, the function learns to project embeddings into a continuous space, where they can be compared against other such projections by their dot-product.
One could easily implement multi-head-attention with the dynamic matrix method, by a function $b(k, q)$ yielding the (log) probability that the two correspond, and putting that into a dynamic-size matrix.

My question is what in the ""all you need"" core attention method makes it better than the ""align and translate"" core attention method?
Are there ablation studies for this point?
My intuition tells me it would be easier for a network to learn how to correspond vectors, rather than to learn an entire continuous space.

Again, please disregard the other contributions in ""all you need"", such as self-attention, separation of key from value, normalization, Transformer, ect.
","['papers', 'transformer', 'attention', 'sequence-modeling']","The key difference between the attention mechanisms used in ""Learning To Align And Translate"" and ""Attention Is All You Need"" lies in the way that the similarity between the query and key vectors is calculated.The attention score is calculated by a learned function using a feed-forward neural network that takes in the query and key vectors and outputs a (log) probability of correspondence between them. This approach requires the model to learn a mapping from the input and output spaces to a joint space where the vectors can be compared against each other.Here the attention is calculated as the similarity between the query and key vectors by taking their dot product and scaling it by the square root of their dimensionality. This approach does not require the model to learn a mapping to a joint space, but instead relies on the inherent structure of the vector space.One advantage of the approach used in ""Attention Is All You Need"" is that it is computationally more efficient than the method used in ""Learning To Align And Translate"", especially for long sequences. Specifically, the scaled dot product attention is faster compared to ""general/Bahdanau attention"" in the sense that the latter is a learnt via a usually shallow feedforward neural network. In that sense, overhead space and time complexity is added while traversing the computational graph of the model as part of training.That being said, there have been studies that have explored the use of different attention mechanisms in Transformers, including variants of the dot product and learned similarity functions. While the dot product attention used in ""Attention Is All You Need"" has shown to be effective in many cases, other mechanisms may be more appropriate for certain tasks or data types.I copy below recent studies relevant to transformer variations and its attention mechanism."

I am playing around with a decoder only transformer model,
The Colab is here if you find that easier
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SHyJ9Oa3E4j1x8YFlXQbd1mjUjWhHGOV#scrollTo=60e13119
or see the code below (should run with minimal deps in a notebook)
Goal:

I am playing around to understand the transformer architecture. I wanted to build a minimal version of a decoder only model and see if i can train the model to predict the last digit in this sequence (think of it as a recall function from a key value store).
Want to get an intuitive understanding on the linear transformations of the weight matrices to the sequence input + positional encodings.

n9 v8 a5 p7 k0 j1 i3 e2 g6 c4 c - (should be 4)
d5 t3 q8 r7 y1 i0 c2 n9 s4 u6 i - (should be 0) ...
l8 u9 p5 y3 f7 k0 g6 v4 r1 x2 l
a7 x5 b6 v0 i1 f3 z9 d4 y2 k8 x
m9 h4 g5 t2 l3 f1 w7 b6 a8 j0 g
x0 g7 q9 u2 j8 v4 h3 o1 f5 r6 r
r6 c4 d0 p3 j2 g9 a7 n1 e8 l5 d
r2 z7 y6 x5 v4 u1 s3 a8 l9 p0 z
k0 u3 t1 r4 g8 p2 j5 x9 s7 v6 t
o7 a1 u3 r2 k6 j0 m8 y9 e4 c5 j

Questions:

The accuracy is not improving, so i guess there is some fundamental issue with the model. It looks like it is learning that it is a digit, but not what digit.

Assuming that I have 1 hidden layer with 3 neurons and 2 output neurons, I would like to know if my understanding of this simple neural net in a Matrix notation is correct?
X = \begin{bmatrix}1&2&3\\3&4&6\\6&8&1\end{bmatrix}
My weights Matrix would then look like:
W = \begin{bmatrix}W_{11}&W_{12}&W_{13}\\W_{21}&W_{22}&W_{23}\end{bmatrix}
Assuming the bias to be 0, my multi-variate summation equation for Neuron 1 in the hidden layer will look like (in a Matrix dot product representation):
First I guess I cannot multiply both the Matrices as it does not satisfy the rule where number or columns from Matrix 1 (in my case Matrix X) should equal the number of rows from Matrix 2 (my weights Matrix w). Correct?
So my questions are now:

Should I then choose my hidden layer to have 3 neurons?

Is my overall understanding of the whole concept correct?

Is Machine learning a good approach for this geometric challenge?,"
For months I have been working on a conventional algorithm that positions circles with different sized radii and either positive or negative charge within an outer radius in such a way that the charge balances out as much as possible. You can think of it like differently charged magnets on an infinitely slippery oil film, arranging themselves until they reach a global minimum of forces.

So far, the results are not good and, especially for complex setups with many circuits, very poor. Also, the calculation takes a very long time.
Now I would like to understand if this is a good use case for a ML model:
I can create any number of learning data sets consisting of the following:

features: The xy coordinates, the radius and the charge (+/-) of the circles, where the number of circles can vary from 1 to 100.
target: for each setup a measure of the ""homogeneity"" of the charges.

With this, you could then possibly train an ML model, which you then only have to give the radii and charges of the circles, and it gives you back the ideal xy coordinates for each circle.
Would something like that be conceivable? Especially because the features are so ""multi-dimensional""? And what would be a good start?

Can we use Low rank approximation in Markov decision process problem?,"
I am newbie in MDP.I have started reading Ronald Howard Dynamic Programming and MDP book as well as Sutton and Barto An Introduction to Reinforcement Learning. To my understanding MDP is a model based (not free) process unlike SARSA and TD. The toy examples presented in both books (specially Ronald Howard's that I have run in my computer) for the value iteration have the element by element multiplication of matrices (Hadamard product) $\Pi$ (t.p.m) and $R$ (reward matrix).
$$q = \Pi \odot R$$
$q$ matrix might have large dimensions (columns).Is it proper to factorize this $q$ matrix (decompose it) ? I was thinking low rank approximations. But I have a concern: If I lose some elements of this $q$ matrix I will lose some paths, possible actions and policies that will not lead me to my target state. Am I correct ?

Query regarding the minimax value function of GANs,"
In the book Generative AI with Python and TensorFlow 2 from Babcock and Bali (page 172), it is stated that the value function of a GAN is the following:

where D(x) is the output of the discriminator and G(z) is the output of the generator. However I don't understand why there is a product of two logarithms. The value D(x) is supposed to be a probability, meaning that D(x) lies in the number interval between 0 and 1. Having that into account the log D(x) would be a negative number, so log log D(x) shouldn't exist because the log of a negative number doesn't exist.
Can anyone shed some light into this? Is the function wrong or is there anything I am missing?

Is the GPT-4 for text the same model that can input and output images?,"
Currently, the published GPT-4 can input and output text.
A version of GPT-4 that can input and output text and images exists, according to the technical report, but is not yet publicly available.
I suspect that they are the same.
Only the interface for image input and output is not publicly available.
That is because GPT-4 shows some understanding of images if you find a way to output them. One way is asking it to write a program that produces the image output. And that actually works, demonstrated below:

Prompt: ""Write a program that creates a picture of HAL 9000""
[System prompt empty]

The result is this image (created by following the directions in the text output):

The following is the unedited GPT-4 output (formatting in the original):

Creating a visual program requires a programming language with graphics libraries or frameworks, as well as a specific platform or environment to run the code. Here's an example using Python and the Pygame library to create a simple picture of HAL 9000:

First, you need to install the Pygame library if you haven't already. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

pip install pygame


Next, create a new Python file (e.g. hal9000.py) and paste the following code:

import pygame

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up the display
width, height = 400, 400
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height))
pygame.display.set_caption(""HAL 9000"")

# Define colors
BLACK = (0, 0, 0)
RED = (255, 0, 0)
WHITE = (255, 255, 255)

# Draw HAL 9000
def draw_hal9000(surface):
    surface.fill(BLACK)
    
    # Draw the outer circle
    pygame.draw.circle(surface, WHITE, (width // 2, height // 2), 100)
    
    # Draw the inner circle
    pygame.draw.circle(surface, RED, (width // 2, height // 2), 80)

    # Draw the lens
    pygame.draw.ellipse(surface, BLACK, (width // 2 - 40, height // 2 - 60, 80, 120))

    # Draw the lens reflection
    pygame.draw.ellipse(surface, WHITE, (width // 2 - 20, height // 2 - 45, 15, 25), 2)

# Main loop
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
    
    draw_hal9000(screen)
    pygame.display.flip()

# Clean up
pygame.quit()


Save the file and run the program using the following command in your terminal:

python hal9000.py

This code will create a simple picture of HAL 9000 using the Pygame library. The main loop will keep the program running until you close the window.
Note: This example assumes that you have Python and pip (package installer for Python) already installed on your system. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Does GPT not need to compress its training data?,"
In his recent short pamphlet on GPT, Stephan Wolfram says

... the 'size of the network' that seems to work well is ... comparable to the 'size of the training data'. ...
in this representation it seems there’s in the end rather little 'compression' of the training data;
it seems on average to basically take only a bit less than one neural net weight to carry the 'information content' of a word of training data.

But this isn't true is it, even by his own account?
He says that the size of the network is 175 billion parameters, and the size of the training data is at least ""a trillion words of text""
(possibly 100 times that). That's a lot less than ""one neural net weight to carry the 'information content' of a word"".

I am making a custom Pytorch model that at some point, clusters a latent space that was created by another, previous routine of the model (Autoencoder).
In a bit more detail, my model is a regular Autoencoder, but in every training step, I want to perform a clustering of the representations in the latent space Z, and save the clustering algorithm inside the model to use after training, ONLY for inference (to make certain kind of predictions).
I thought about defining an sklearn model as an instance of the nn.Module as
class Model(Module):
    def __init__(self, hparams):
        super().__init__()
        self.clustering_model = sklearn.clustering_model()


This way, I could call the clustering model to fit the latent space Z, after calculating the reconstruction loss as a regular autoencoder.
After training, I would then have in the variable model.clustering_model a trained clustering model that I could use for inference.
However, this doesn't seem to work out, probably because of incompatibilities between sklearn and Pytorch. Basically, it seems that training the clustering_model and saving it inside the pytorch model didn't actually save any trained weights.
I'm right now unsure whether it didn't save weights because it actually wasn't trained (by an error on my side) or if it is that PyTorch just can't save a sklearn trained model as a variable in a nn.Module.
Did anyone try before to implement sklearn inside a nn.Module?
","['pytorch', 'autoencoders', 'unsupervised-learning', 'scikit-learn']","Yes, you can define a totally custom Model, maybe with a clustering method you can call after forward only during inference.
Clustering parameters (e.g centroids in Kmeans) can be stored inside a buffer (see here and here)Clustering is not typically optimized with Gradient Descent, so clustering parameters should not require gradient, and you need to pay attention to not include the clustering step into your computational graph.I would implement this pipeline:By using a modular approach, you can experiment different clustering methods without losing all the features (saving additional training), and then put all together once you're satisfied with the model."
Creating a Dataset from Time Series Data,"
Context
I'd like to build a regression model for this data to predict a user's test scores given their study habits.
Basically, the variables are in two separate csv tables similar to the ones below. Eventually, I'd like to create a forecasting model.
Training variables:

Time series data of study habits (multidimensional: location, duration, date, user_id)

Target variables:

Test scores (scores, date, user_id)

Problem

I'm not sure how to actually put together instances regarding time. Do I just say that every training instance before the next test date gets that test result as the target variable?
Is there a term for temporally aligning data in a time series or techniques?

","['datasets', 'time-series', 'training-datasets']","What you are trying to accomplish is called sequence prediction. It takes in a sequence of data, and spits out a score (target variable).Time-series data is usually formatted as 3D arrays with shape (batch size, sample length, data). So in your case, the data would be (location, duration, date, user_id). It's preferable to have all sequences be of the same length by adding padding at the end of sequences that are too short. The padding can be dealt with in the model training itself later on.I'd keep the date variable in the data itself, but maybe format it as an offset, so make the first time studying equal to 0, the second instance equal to the number of hours later (like 24 for the next day) and have the prediction variable as the last offset."
"Compare True Contribution with SHAP Contribution, using simulated data","
I try to compare the true contribution with SHAP Contribution, using simulated data. Because the data is simulated, I have the ground truth contribution of each variable for each observation, which I expected SHAP to give similar contribution. But results are quite different, and I am trying to understand why. Please see details below:

Simulate X: generate 4 random variables (x1,x2,x3 and x4).See code section A.
Similate Y: Let log_odds = x1+x2+x3+x4 (setting all coefficient to 1 and intercept to 0). Then convert log_odds to probability, and use probability to generate binary outcome. Since coefficients are 1 and intercept is 0, the x value is the contribution to the log_odds of the observation. See code section B.
Fit logistic regression. The estimated coefficients are very close to ones used for simulation. The AUC is 0.92. coef: [0.98761674 1.00301607 1.01310563 0.98102926] Intercept [0.03131222]. See code section C.
Get KernelSHAP, and put it side by side with the x table ( the true contribution). See code section D.

The intercept in data generation is 0, and the bias term for SHAP (explainer.expected_value1) is -0.003, which is also close to 0. Thus, I guess I can compare x value with SHAP value for each variable. Please see results for 10 observations below:

The x value and SHAP value are not quite comparable;
For each observation, the contribution rank order within 4 variables (x1,x2,x3,x,4) is not consistent with the rank order in the SHAP value.
In data generation, x1 and x2 are all positive numbers, while x3 and x4 are all negative numbers. Thus in SHAP columns, I would expect to see some pattern, however, the pattern in SHAP columns are quite random.


So my questions are:

Is there any flaw in my testing design, such that the comparison between x value and SHAP value is totally irrelevant?
Is this the SHAP results I should expect?
Why SHAP gives contribution that deviate so much for the actual value and rank order?

Thank you very much in advance!

Why the positive example is included in the denominator of NT-Xent loss?,"

Regression Model diverging after adding a new feature with higher variance and magnitude,"
In a time series regression problem I'm predicting ""change"" rather than the actual intended value i.e
Instead of:

2021, 1.5, 5.2
2022, 1.3, 6.1
now, y_pred_1, y_pred_2, ....

I'm feeding the model and predicting percent changes:
2020 0, 0
2021 0.5, 0.57 # 5.2 / 3.3 - 1 = 0.57 percent change
2022, -0.13, 0.17

Now a problem that I'm facing is that when I introduce a new feature of a much larger magnitude and variance my model diverges during training:
# new feature
2020, 3000
2021 4
2022 600

# Which is transformed to percent changes
2020, 0
2021, 0.99
2022, 149 # oof

I tried mean normalizing that particular feature before transforming it to the percent change domain but it still diverges.
Any ideas what else I can try to introduce this new feature to the inputs? What are some best practices for such contrasted inputs?
To get a general idea of the model if it has something to do with this:
The model consists of 5 parallel flows that get added together at the end. Each flow has two pairs of CNNs with different kernel sizes followed by 1-3 LSTMs. The output shape of each flow is the same so they can be added together. Then after adding it's followed by two fully connected layers predicting the change for the given features.
","['long-short-term-memory', 'keras', 'time-series', 'regression']","The problem as you already pointed out is in the high change variance of the new feature. Normalising using the mean does not impact the variance since it's merely a linear transformation, still good to keep all feature in the same range but not impacting the variance at all.What you need is a non linear transformation that change the magnitude in change variance without introducing artefacts. The most simple thing to try would be to just take the log of the new feature. Since you're working with time series another possibility could be applying a moving average, exploring different time windows to see how much the feature will be smoothed out."
Blurring of image in generative model using diffusion probabilistic method,"
In the 2015 paper ""Deep Unsupervised Learning using Nonequilibrium Thermodynamics"" by Sohl-Dickstein et al. on diffusion for generative models, Figure 1 shows the forward trajectory for a 2-d swiss-roll image using Gaussian diffusion. The thin lines are gradually blurred into wider and fuzzier lines, and eventually into an identity-covariance Gaussian. Table App.1 gives the diffusion kernel as:
$$
q(\mathbf{x}^{(t)} \mid \mathbf{x}^{(t-1)}) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{x}^{(t)} ; \mathbf{x}^{(t-1)} \sqrt{1 - \beta_t}, \mathbf{I} \beta_t )
$$
The covariance of the diffusion kernel is diagonal, so each component $x_i^{(t)}$ (i.e., each pixel in the image at time step $t$) is independently sampled from a 1-d Gaussian based on the prior time step's pixel value at the same x-y location in the image. So a given pixel should NOT diffuse into neighboring pixels; instead, the action of the diffusion step is a linear Gaussian 1-d transformation of the number held in the pixel, with the mean slightly reduced and some noise added.
Question: This seems inconsistent with Figure 1? Instead of the blurred line (wider and fuzzier line), we should have a line that has the same width, but exhibits more noise? In order to have a pixel diffuse into neighboring pixels, we would need a diffusion kernel with a non-diagonal covariance, so that there is nonzero covariance between components?

Does it make sense to store information in a variable defined inside a Pytorch nn.Module?,"
I have a pytorch model (custom model inherited from nn.Module).
I'm developing some architecture, for which makes sense for my task to have a list defined in the model as:
class Model(nn.Module):
   def __init__(self, hparams):
       super().__init__()
       self.list = []

In every training step, I want to store in this list some information. Particularly, a number that I will calculate over the training step.
To be more clear:
for each training step I receive a batch of size $n$, and in the training step I update the self.list in Model to store $n$ values. For instance, after a first iteration with a batch size of 100, the self.list list will contain 100 values. Every iteration, I will add 100 more to the list...
I mean, this makes sense for my task, but I'm wondering if this is ""legal"". Also it seems a bit weird, because the parameters of my model would increase with the training size? Because in the end, if I use 10,000 training samples, this list will hold 10,000 values. But if I use more, the list will have more. Would this be an increase in parameters? When I save this model, will the number of parameters be affected by this? That's what I'm not sure about.
","['neural-networks', 'pytorch', 'weights']","Generally, your PyTorch module is to contain the architecture that you are training, not the additional variables that you want to store. So generally, I would not implement my list like this.What is usually done is to have one nn.Module for the architecture and one generic class for utility functions such as the model training/fitting/validation etc. Then the module is passed to the generic 'Trainer' class for training the model and your list of values would presumably be stored in the 'Trainer' object.So something like this:"
How do we determine the slope for leakyrelu activation function?,"
I am using LeakyReLU activation function in my architecture. We know that the default slope value is 1e-2. I want to understand how do we decide that what slope value should we choose?
","['pytorch', 'activation-functions', 'leaky-relu']","There is definitely no 'mathematically optimal' LeakyReLU value, as it is dependent on the data, the architecture etc.In addition, to the best of my knowledge, there is no 'best practice' when it comes to LeakyReLU slope values. Most of the deep learning papers just state they use LeakyReLU with some slope parameter without mentioning why they choose the parameter. They might, or even might not, have tuned the parameter with simple empirical testing.The goal of LeakyRelu is simply to reduce the 'dying relu' problem. As long as there is any slope, this dying relu problem is mitigated. You could probably show that the dying relu problem persists by slope values very close to 0. With a default of 0.02, 0.01 or anything relatively significant, leaky relu does the job it is meant to do. I have seen LeakyRelu slopes up to 0.2-0.3 in GAN literature.Do not expect a small difference in LeakyReLU values to drastically influence the result of your network. It might help a tiny bit during tuning, but I'd recommend starting with the default value and then continuing with the rest of your model training. Come back to tuning the LeakyRelu only during the final model optimization and see if you can make any significant difference by wiggling the value around the default value."
Convert unstructured text to XML,"
I am working with a large dataset (example bellow) of unstructured and structured documents that contain a variety of text elements, including paragraphs, tables, and lists. Currently, the process of generating the equivalent XML markup for each text element is done manually. I am looking to automate this process by using machine learning.
I am considering two possible approaches:
The first approach would be to treat this as a translation problem and use a transformer model to generate the XML markup automatically. This would involve training the model to translate the text elements into their corresponding XML markup.
The second approach would be to treat this as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) problem in natural language processing (NLP). In this approach, the model would be trained to recognize the different text elements and assign them the appropriate XML markup.
Or there are better approaches ?

Even if a person would ask clarifying questions (that I assume are in the train set) ChatGPT doesn't, opting instead to invent context or just say ""X depends on Y, Z""...
Not asking questions seems trained into the network, but I am not sure how one would go about training a model not to generate questions in such a way that not even in DAN mode it doesn't. I understand that for toxic language GPT-3 uses human raters to generate a train set and then optimizes for non toxic behavior, but it seems to specific to be used for the general concept of questions.

"Does OpenAI ChatGPT has any ""dialogue state tracking"" besides max tokens to include previous conversation history?","
When I chat with chatGPT earlier, chatGPT itself mentioned ""dialogue state tracking"" technique that is utilized in addition to chat completion with previous conversation history(up to max allowed tokens).
Is this just a specific technique or this is just some general term. As a specific technique, can we outline how it is done?
The background this question is that it seems chatGPT can take a very long initial ""instruction"", e.g. like a tutor prompt with detailed behavior protocol.
And even after a few rounds questions, it still behave as instructed pretty completely and not wondering off back to its normal style.
Really want to know how it can achieve this and is the open ai API side of chatCompletion

Image Alignment/Homography of Subject in Bounding Box,"
I've been trying to design an algorithm for aligning an object across two photos in realtime. I am able to localize the object (create an ROI/BBox) through an object detection (siamese) network for both photos, leaving me with a cropped image with the object in the center for both frames.
I am struggling to do the second step of my proposed algorithm, which is ""finetuning"" the alignment of one of the objects in the bounding box by calculating a homography with respect to the ""template"" crop. Ideally, I would like to be able to overlay the transformed second image on the first image and have the object roughly aligned in the image.
I have been trying to use cv2.findHomography using ORB descriptors and keypoints, however I find that the ORB extractor or the feature matcher ends up being inaccurate, leading to terrible transformation estimates when the object becomes non-stationary. ORB especially seems hard to tune, with the parameter that picks up enough keypoints being fastThreshold=5 which seems abnormally low to me. I use ORB features since I am aiming to use a ""free"" algorithm, unlike SURF or SIFT.
For context, here is an example of the cropped images I'm trying to align after the object is rotated w.r.t. the bounding box. The subject is a keycap I had laying around. The original image isn't that blurry -- I applied cv2.blur(img, (15,15)) before attempting to detect feature and match them.
.
Aligning these images seems like it should be a simple task, but I'm increasingly worried that classical CV is insufficient for alignment. My background is not in classical CV and so I'm not sure if there is some trick/algorithm that can efficiently align these objects. Alternatively, suggestions for heuristics to determine robust parameters to these OpenCV methods or engineer my data to be more suitable would be appreciated.
My background is biased towards neural networks and I'm worried that I need to turn to neural network-based approaches for image alignment or replace my object detector with a more end-to-end estimate of the orientation of the bounding box. Either way, the aim would be to perform this alignment in realtime on consumer hardware.
Thanks!

Final Model Training Problem - Overfitting,"
I am working on a CNN project for multiclass classification. I implemented hyperparameter optimization to find the most suitable model, during which I got a best accuracy of 97.38%. I then took this model and applied Early Stopping to it, but the results were much worse. To start, the accuracy dropped greatly. Second, the model seems to be overfitting the data, as shown in the learning curve below. Test loss stops dropping after the shown point, and the training loss goes down to almost zero. I have tried implementing some techniques like Dropout, weight decay, and using different batch sizes, but the issue still persists: the train loss goes down rapidly and converges quickly while the test loss saturates at a specific point and does not yield good prediction results. What are some other steps which I can implement to solve this issue. Can I fix the model during Early Stopping straight away, or do I have to rerun the hyperparameter optimization from the beginning?

What can convolution layer without batch normalization and activation function contribute to models?,"
I recently saw some paper about stereo matching :
End-to-End Learning of Geometry and Context for Deep Stereo Regression [1]
https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2017/papers/Kendall_End-To-End_Learning_of_ICCV_2017_paper.pdf
End-to-End Learning for Omnidirectional
Stereo Matching with Uncertainty Prior [2](which isn't free to see this paper. But the DL model is almost as same as Gc-net paper, except the model is for wide angle multi camera )
These papers are about stereo matching in computer vision area, The models in the papers are composed of Unary feature extraction + cost volume (As simple you can think it as concatenating 2 or more data's feature) + 3D convolution.
What I don't understand fully is in the Unary feature extraction part, the models have some 2D convolution layers with residual connection, and then after this there's a 2D convolution layer with no activation and batch normalization before cost volume part.
The gc-net [1]'s unary feature extraction works like
(1) 5x5 conv, 32 features, stride 2-> (2) 3x3 conv, 32 features -> (3) 3x3 conv, 32 features
(4) (1)-(3) residual connection
(5) (2), (3) repeat a few times with residual connection
(6) 3x3 conv, 32 features (no ReLu or BN)

What does this (6) convolution layer without activation and batch normalization contribute to the model?
In the 'End-to-End Learning for Omnidirectional Stereo Matching with Uncertainty Prior'[2] paper says that

the last layer without the ReLU in the feature extraction part allows
the network to distinguish between negative features and invisible
areas, where the network is set to zero by the ReLU and warping
operations, respectively.

But I can't understand how the layer without activation function and normalization contribute above things.
And in 3D convolution part of Gc-net [1] also has no-ReLu, or BN too. The paper says

The network can also pre-scale the matching costs to control the
peakiness (sometimes called temperature) of the normalized
post-softmax probabilities (Figure 2). We explicitly omit
batch normalization from the final convolution layer in the
unary tower to allow the network to learn this from the data.

Which means 3D conv layer without BN helps 'softargmin' (or softargmax) function not to have multi-modal distribution. This thing I don't understand how the conv layer without activation and and normalization has such ability.

Model-based RL algorithms for continuous state space and finite action space,"
At the beginning, if I have a complete model $p(s' \mid s, a)$ (an assumed true model that describes the environment well enough) and the reward function $r(s,a,s')$. How can I exploit the model and learn a good policy in this situation? Assume that the state space is continuous, and the action space is finite.
Traditional dynamic programming/planning methods like policy iteration or value iteration cannot be directly applied since there are infinitely many states. If I try to get samples from the model and apply an algorithm like DQN or any non-linear function approximation, it looks like that I use the model-free approach and do not get the full advantages of the model.
May I ask if there are any reinforcement learning/planning methods that use the explicit model given at the beginning to solve the MDP? (in case of continuous state space and finite action space)
","['reinforcement-learning', 'reference-request', 'model-based-methods', 'continuous-state-spaces', 'discrete-action-spaces']","In optimal control field to minimize certain well-defined costs especially in process industries, continuous state space model-based planning methods such as model predictive control (MPC) is a common decision time planning/control method which can handle both linear and nonlinear models, and unlike training data intensive model-free RL methods it's much more data efficient, faster, online, and good (though may not optimal):MPC is based on iterative, finite-horizon optimization of a plant model. At time
$t$ the current plant state is sampled and a cost minimizing control strategy is computed (via a numerical minimization algorithm) for a relatively short time horizon in the future:$[t,t+T]$. Specifically, an online or on-the-fly calculation is used to explore state trajectories that emanate from the current state and find (via the solution of Euler–Lagrange equations) a cost-minimizing control strategy until time $t+T$. Although this approach is not optimal, in practice it has given very good results. Much academic research has been done to find fast methods of solution of Euler–Lagrange type equations, to understand the global stability properties of MPC's local optimization, and in general to improve the MPC method.If your model is linear (most mechanical systems) and cost is quadratic, LQR is also a common optimal feedback control method.The main differences between MPC and LQR are that LQR optimizes across the entire time window (horizon) whereas MPC optimizes in a receding time window,[4] and that with MPC a new solution is computed often whereas LQR uses the same single (optimal) solution for the whole time horizon.Finally similar to Dyna-Q learning architecture with background learning & planning introduced in Sutton and Barto's Reinforcement Learning, An Introduction, especially if your initial known sample model is not accurate or keeps evolving, one can combine model-based with model-free RL methods, you just replace tabular Q-planning there with your linear or nonlinear function approximations planning version such as described in Jong and Stone's paper Model-Based Exploration in Continuous State Spaces:This paper develops a method
for approximating continuous models by fitting data to a finite sample of states, leading to finite representations compatible with existing
model-based exploration mechanisms. Experiments with the resulting
family of fitted-model reinforcement learning algorithms reveals the critical importance of how the continuous model is generalized from finite
data. This paper demonstrates instantiations of fitted-model algorithms
that lead to faster learning on benchmark problems than contemporary
model-free RL algorithms that only apply generalization in estimating
action values. Finally, the paper concludes that in continuous problems,
the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is better construed as a balance between exploration and generalization."

Periodical fluctuations in loss curves,"
I am training a neural network (specifically a GRU based architecture but I think this is not too relevant for the question). My loss curves, especially the training loss but also the validation loss, show periodic fluctuations and I try to understand why (see picture). I am evaluating the model 4 times per epoch (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%) to monitor training progress, dataset consists of roughly 5.5M sample sequences (the task is item recommendation). As you can see from the picture, the fluctuations are exactly 4 steps long (= one epoch). The metric on the picture is the Hit-Ratio for top-1 predictions so just accuracy on the train set.

The only reason I could think of that would explain these periodic fluctuations would be, that the data is fed to the model in the same order each epoch leading to similar learning signals at similar parts of the epoch. But I load the training data using PyTorchs DataLoader with shuffle=True, so this does not seem to be the reason.
Can you think of any other reasons for such a behavior?

ReLU transform all negative values to zero. But Batch-Normalization already transforms all values by restricting them to a value between zero and one. So ReLU will not have any effect when applied after BN, because there will not be any negative values left.

Why this single layer perceptron for the add operation not learning the correct weights?,"
This might be unnecessary but to learn the basics of neural networks, I am trying to create a single perceptron neural network to solve the adding operation of 2 inputs (x1 + x2 = ybar)
The code is written in C# since the math should be very simple and it's a language I use usually more than python.
The problem is the network is not capable of learning the right weights for this simple problem so I am trying to understand why is that before checking another working example on the internet
Note before explaining more about the problem, feel free to include any level of math or technical stuff (although might not be needed for this simple question).

Learns is the time the backpropagation happens. So equal to the nb of batches.
Activation function takes x and rounds it to the nearest integer.
The cost function is yBar - y. The total cost for each batch is the sum of all the costs generated by the samples in that batch divided by the batch size (so the average).
Backpropagation is in the form of w[i+1] = w[i] - learningRate * cost.
The hope is that w1 and w2 should end up having the same value after backpropagation.
To test the code I tried first on 1 input:

It learns a combination of weights for that case to work.
But then I tried generating a random training set of 500 rows and changing the batch size to 10 expecting it to generalize the problem and the weights to be in the form of w1 ~= w2. But it is failing to do so.
Most of the predictions are away from the correct value by 30 or 40 with some exceptions that are far by a 100.
I am not sure about how to think of the problem. This is supposed to be a linear problem so the activation function should not be the issue.
I suspected the way the cost is calculated might be the issue, but there doesn't seem to be a more fitting cost function for this adding operation.
Tried changing the learning rate and the initial weights with being pretty sure that these are not the problem, and it also didn't work.
How to think of this problem ? What are the clues to look for in order to find the wrong parameter ? And how to fix it ?

Does human attention finitude make impossible to control an expanding AI?,"
The feedback given by humans to align artificial intelligence is limited by the reaction time and processing speed of the finite number of us, now less than $2^{33}$.  As an artificial intelligence (or a growing number of them) grows in complexity, more and more possible actions need to be checked for human compatibility. But human feedback cannot grow at the pace of that expanding machine, therefore necessarily weakening the coupling between natural and artificial intelligence.

What degree of randomness is required for a stochastic policy learning task?,"
I am working on an reinforcement learning training task:
My policy network is LSTM+Gumbel-Softmax, so the sampled policy (i.e. a list of discrete categorical intergers) can be differentiable.
The obtained policy will interract with the environment to generate a final overall accuracy (The goal here is to improve some classification performance).
However, due to the randomness of Gumbel, the training/validation curves look super noisy and it always fluctuates. However, if I deliberately fixed random seed to 0 for each input sample, the curves are stable and achieved a decent validation accuracy.
My objective is for enigneering, instead of publishing or claiming a better method than others. But I understand the ideal scenario is that, I don't set a seed at all, and learning just gave me a nice model which works for any seeds.
My experiment is like this:  During training, I reset random seed to 0 before each input sample enters the network.  During testing, I also reset random seed to 0 before each test sample enters the network. And the final accuracy is high for test samples (However, if I change to a different seed, the accuracy can be really low).
Could someone provide some comments and feedback whether my experiment is correct? Can I use the above trained model with seed (0) for real world prediction tasks?  My feeling is that, if I zoom out to view this as a normal deep-learning task (training data and testing data are separated and test accuracy looks decent), I don't see any problems. But it is kind of scary that my model has to work with random seed fixed to 0.

Reproducing AlphaZero/MuZero: Failed to beat initial model in arena,"
I am trying to reproduce AlphaZero's algorithm on the board game Carcassonne. Since I want to use the final game score differences (i.e. victory point of player 1 - victory point of player 2) as the final and only reward, AlphaZero's UCB score can no longer work since it assumed that the game reward is either 1 or -1. Therefore, I am using the trick from MuZero, which, when computing UCB score, normalizes the child value estimate to the range $[0, 1]$ using the minimum and maximum value estimates in the entire tree.
However, after implementing this, my algorithm almost never get past the first iteration, since the win-rate against last iteration is almost never higher than 50% (I am using an arena threshold of 0.55). If I don't normalize the reward, then the win rate seems to be higher.
My hypothesis is that, in the first few MCTS searches, there are not many estimates in the tree, and a few of the node values will be normalized to 0 or 1, which are very extreme, despite their original model-predicted values being very small in magnitude. This may cause the tree to overfit to these values instead of exploring other nodes.

Is this a common issue with self-play, or is it indicative of a bug in my implementation?
What are some common ways to overcome the issue (e.g. increasing data, MCTS iterations, etc)? If the algorithm does not get past the first arena, then it will never progress since it always gets reset to the initial model.

","['reinforcement-learning', 'monte-carlo-tree-search', 'alphazero', 'self-play', 'muzero']","I've tried to organize my answer as best as possible, first answering your specific questions and then giving some higher level thoughts.PUCT as used in AlphaZero doesn't actually require that $Q \in [0, 1]$. The term $Q + c_{puct} U$ is only used to compare nodes to each other, so any constant offset is irrelevant. Additionally, scaling Q can be compensated by scaling $c_{puct}$. So you can scale down $Q$ like they did for MuZero, but just tuning $c_{puct}$ should work just as well.You're trying to use the in-game score as the value instead of just the expected winrate. I'm not sure if this is a good idea, I would start with the winrate: it's constrained to a small range which makes both PUCT and neural network training simpler and more stable.AlphaZero has a lot of moving parts, which can make it hard to debug. How I approach debugging AlphaZero:Carcassonne is a stochastic game, you don't know what tile you're going to draw in the next turn. This is a big obstacle when doing any tree search, how are you handling this right now? Typically this is represented using chance nodes, for example in the Stochastic MuZero paper. Unfortunately for Carcassonne the branching factor of these nodes is very high: you can draw every remaining tile, so up to 84. This seems like a big obstacle to using AlphaZero-like methods here, I'm not sure if there's a good solution to this problem."

So, the shape of weight matrix between input layer and next layer will be of some shape compatible with 244x244x3 image,  Now If I am loading VGG with input shape (124x124x3), Does the weight matrix between input layer and next layer will be removed? and replaced by new weight matrix compatible with 124x124x3 image and Does this new weight matrix is also trained or it is frozen?

Theoretical question about reinforcement learning episodes,"
I have a theoretical question about RL. I use Unity ml-agents, but maybe this is more a generalized thing.
In Unity ml-agents there is this concept that actions in episodes that generate more overall rewards will be prioritized over actions in less reward-full episode. This kind of doesn't make sense to me, because some action in the more rewarding episode can be worse then ones in the less rewarding one (especially for long episodes). And in general an action should prioritized depending on the step-to-step reward in respect to future rewards and those discount factor (gamma), right?
But why then giving tiny negative constant reward on every step can make the agent learn to end the episode faster? And why its recommended to have constant max step length for continuous tasks? And this concept of ""agent comparing episodes"" people are using?
Practical example is training a car to drive different length tracks. Longer track means more rewards. But should it create a problem, because of the ""episode reward comparing""?

"Do you know of a website/resource that gives the latest status of ""deep fake"" use cases/tools?","
I'm looking for a good summary of the state of tools for making AI generated videos of people talking. This can be no-code, low-code, or running/tweaking actual code.
Here are some use-cases. I would like to know, for each of these, what tools exist, what tools might exist soon, etc. I'm using Donald Trump as the example, but it could be any person.

Start with a video of me talking and making facial expressions, and create a video with Donald Trump's face making the same expressions and mouth movements, and still with my voice. (It looks like https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap does this well.)

Like #1, but with Donald Trump's voice instead of mine. (I looked at voice.ai for this, but it didn't have great quality, and also required you to do a fairly good impression of the person to start with. It also has what seems like a flaky/buggy UI. Plus I'd like an opensource tool. I also looked at fakeyou.com and wasn't able to get an example without paying.)

Write a script, perhaps including some direction for facial or hand expressions, and create a video where Donald Trump speaks the script in his voice, with his cadence/speaking style, and ideally with his corresponding facial and hand mannerisms / body language.


I did do a bunch of googling for this stuff. I got buried in an avalanche of marketing speak and hucksterism. I'm looking for a reliable index of tools that actually work. Naively, based on how well visual training works, I would think that a model could be trained on lots of Donald Trump talking videos, and then you could give it a script and it would do the voice, cadence, mannerisms, expressions. I did read that voice is just harder than video, because of the many overlayed frequencies. Does that make #3 impossible currently or in the near future?

I want to create a continuing (non-episodic) reinforcement learning environment for chiller plant operation. There are some tutorials focusing on creating environments for the episodic case, however I couldn't find one for the non-episodic cases.
My problem is involving scheduling 3 chiller plant for energy optimisation. The state, action spaces and reward function are something like what is defined below.
S : {temperature, demand}
A : {c1 condensor, c1 evaporator, c1 compressor, c2 condensor, ... , c3 compressor} - where c1, c2 and c3 refer to the 3 chillers
R : f(suppy, load) - some function defined based on supply and load
As my environment is sitting in a Simulink model I need to solve the RL problem in MATLAB (RLToolBox). However any method of creating an environment in OpenAI gym is fine as well since I believe all these frameworks work in a similar fashion.
The main issue I am having is how we define the ""done"" (""isdone"" in MATLAB) variable, as this case is non-episodic. The general procedure for the episodic case is ...
next_state, reward, done, info = env.step(action) (Gym implementation)
I believe we just don't pass anything for ""done"" variable in the non episodic case. Am I correct?.
Further if we don't pass anything to the ""done"" variable how would the algorithm eventually terminate. By this what I mean is for practical purposes even for non-episodic cases must eventually terminate (I think, maybe I am incorrect) so that things like performance criteria can be measured.
Another issue is what would you pass to the environment reset function? Would it be None value?
If so how do define a termination criteria in non-episodic cases? or does it happen from the algorithm side (i.e DDPG implementation in RLToolBox/stable baseline)?. When something like the RLAgent finding the optimal policy (q -> q*) happens?
Any knowledge on this much appreciated as I am just starting out RL.
Thanks

Out-of-domain generalization,"
Given $X$ the space of all $N \times N$-pixel images and $I=\{$airplane,clock,axe,...$\}$ a set of labels.
An image classification task is generally concerned to learn a map
$$F:X \rightarrow I$$
Let's look at the examples of pictures below taken from 2. The rows classify the domain of the picture. I.e. a real plane or a sketched plane. Out-of-domain generalization deals with the question of whether it is possible to train a NN e.g. on real photos of planes such that it will also be able to classify sketched pictures of a plane.

I have a hard time understanding these domains. My question is the following: Can I think of each domain as a disjoint set in $X$. Let's say $X_1$ are all sketched planes and $X_2$ all real planes. Then $X_1 \cap X_2 = \emptyset$. If not, what is the right way to think about domains?

","['neural-networks', 'machine-learning', 'convolutional-neural-networks', 'image-recognition', 'generalization']","You can interpret the image as follows:For example, a human can interpret a sketch as a plane (instead of as a set of lines and curves) thanks to its higher-level cognitive capabilities that allow, at the same time, to see something in its building blocks (e.g. the lines; which is kind of low-level understanding) and as a whole (giving it some semantics and meaning.)Take as an example an image classifier, you train it on images from the real domain. The classifier, in order to show out-of-domain (OOD) generalization should correctly classify images from the quickdraw domain: if so it achieved OOD generalization on that domain. In order to do this, the model should (at least): 1) not adapt to the training domain (which translates to almost zero overfitting and plenty of regularization), 2) ignore the noise in the images (robustness), and 3) capture high-level features that describe the image semantically, i.e. it should capture the concept that an image describes but also capture the same on OOD images."

2D convolution with channels versus 3D convolution for layers of a map?,"
Introduction
I am considering to use a convolutional neural network in implementing Monte Carlo control with function approximation. I am using a Monte Carlo estimate as it is unbiased and has nice convergence properties. Of course, it has high variance and slower convergence.
The goal is to control a game such that episodic reinforcement learning is used. In fact, the game is Mckinsey Plant-defense game. Below is an image of the game:

Problem specification
I have written a rough simulator of the game and then written a function that splits the board into various 14 x 14 layers. More specifically, the layers contain the following:

Layer 1 is a (14,14) array of zeros with a 1 at the location of the plant.
Layers 2-4 are (14,14) arrays of zeros with ones placed at coordinates containing terrain. For example, layer 2 contains only the location of cliffs.
Layers 5-7 are like layers 2-4 but contain locations of defenders, i.e., snake.
Layers 8 and 9 are also (14,14) arrays of zeros. However, if an attacker is present at $(i,j)$ in the grid, a value between zero and 1 is placed there. A such, both the remaining health and location are presented in a layer. Layer 8is for the foxes and layer 9 is for the groundhogs.
The grid of the actual game varies. Sometimes it's a (10,10) grid, (14,10), (12,12), etc. As such, I cast these grids onto a (14,14) grid. The last layer is thus a (14,14) array of zeros with ones placed in locations that do not exist. In other words, the ones indicate where I have padded the original grid. For example, a (12,12) grid would have a border of ones.

Naturally, there is spatial interaction in each layer but also interaction between layers. I am considering two approaches to a convolution architecture. Note, I am using PyTorch, so I apologise if I am using PyTorch-specific terminology.
Approaches: 2D (with channels) vs 3D (no channels) convolution
Approach 1
Approach 1 uses 2D convolution with channels.
$$
y_{h,i,j} = \sum_{k=1}^{C_{in}}\sum_{l=1}^{H_k}\sum_{m=1}^{W_k}w_{h,k,l,m}x_{k,i+l-1,j+m-1}
$$
Where $h=1,2,\dots,C_{out}$ are output channels, $k=1,2,\dots,C_{in}$ is the input channels, $l=1,2,\dots,K_H$ is the height of the kernel, $m=1,2,\dots,K_W$ is the width of the kernel, $x$ is the layers of the map and $y$ is the output of the convolution. In PyTorch's Conv2d function, if I set groups=1 then all input channels are convolved with all output channels as in the formula. Does this capture interaction between channels?
Approach 2
The second approach would instead treat the 10 stacked layers as a 3D image of shape (10,14,14) with one channel. The formula for this would read as below:
$$
y_{i,j,k} = \sum_{m=1}^{D_k}\sum_{n=1}^{H_k}\sum_{o=1}^{W_k}w_{m,n,o}x_{i+m-1,j+n-1,k+o-1}
$$
It would seem that this would capture more of the dependencies between layers? I would imagine that this is the approach they would use in medical imaging where the image has layers that strongly interact.
Question
Which approach is most suitable for modelling dependencies within layers and between layers? Can you please provide me with some intuition on why? I would also not mind reading recommended literature. Thank you for your time.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'convolutional-neural-networks', 'pytorch', 'convolution', 'convolution-arithmetic']","First of all, I don't think that the two approaches are the same as @lev1248 claims. When using a 3D convolution the 3d filters have depth equal to kernel_size and you slide your filter along the $D$ dimension as well.I think that Approach 1 is better because you want to pay attention to all of the channels while sliding along the 14x14 plane. Note that the convolutional layer was designed to take advantage of translational invariance. So neurons are activated if they see something (plant, terrain, etc.) regardless of its location. The sliding kernel will slide along the 14x14 plane and whenever it ""sees"" something it will activate. Now regarding the channel dimension, you actually have a one-hot encoding of what exactly is present at a given location, as I understand 10 different options. You wouldn't want to slide a kernel along this dimension and output the same activation regardless of where it sees the $1$. You want to take the contents of the entire channel into consideration.If you set groups=1 in the Conv2d layer initializer (which is the default option) then you get the standard normal convolution. This means that each of the output channels contains the information from all of the input channels. The kernel is convolved with the input, channels are not convolved. So, yes, this captures the interaction.The other extreme would be to set groups=in_channels (which is 10 in your case). Then you split your input tensor (10, 14, 14) into 10 input tensors of size (1, 14, 14), you perform the convolution along each one separately and you concatenate the results. In this case you do not capture the interaction between the channels. Usually, when you do this, you add an additional 1x1 convolutional layer after that that will intermix the channels. This approach is called a depthwise-separable convolution and was introduced in the MobileNet paper. This will harm the accuracy of the model, but greatly reduces the number of parameters and is the preferred approach for models that will be deployed on mobile phones and other edge devices.You can read more about splitting into groups here: https://pi-tau.github.io/posts/res-nets/#the-resnext-block-going-wider-instead-deeper"
Can an LLM such as GPT learn from a sentence prediction that is close in meaning but drastically different in wording?,"
Consider this example:  husband cheats on wife, AI predicts that wife gets angry.  AI predicts that wife may either scream or throw things, with screaming a higher probability.  Turns out in reality it is observed that the wife throws things.
Assume that this AI is a current LLM built with Transformer architecture.
It predicts ""wife screams"", then observes ""wife throws things"".  The error = loss function is positive.  This error is back-propagated all the way back to the Transformer's input layer.  The gradient of the error with respect to the weights is calculated and adjusted in the direction to lessen the error, ie, the prediction of ""screaming"".
So we expect the weight(s) connecting ""wife angry -> wife screams"" would be weakened.  This is OK, as the model learns that ""wife angry -> wife throws things"" is a more likely outcome.
(Let's, for the sake of this example, ignore that there are other people whose expression of anger may be different from the wife's.  Just assume the world has only 1 person who may get angry and it's the wife.)
But the problem is in the next backward step:  wife jealous -> wife angry.  This is actually a correct prediction.  But it is along the chain of thoughts ""wife jealous -> wife angry -> wife screams"" which got the wrong prediction.
From my understanding of back-prop, the gradient of ""wife jealous -> wife angry"" would also be weakened, due to the chain rule of differentiation used in back-prop.
In short, the correct prediction of a hidden state is somehow weakened just because the hidden state predicted a consequence that, though it is itself probable, is not exactly the consequence being observed.  But such situations may occur very often.
Is my analysis above wrong?  Such that ""wife jealous -> wife angry"" is somehow enhanced despite the ""wife angry -> wife screams"" prediction was a bit off?
Thanks for shedding any light on this question.

Do GNNs operate on enitre graphs or do they basically iterate over each node one-by-one?,"
I understand how GNNs/GCNs aggregate an arbitrary number of nodes' information from the neighborhood of a target node in order to predict an attribute of that target node. What I don't understand is, when we predict this attribute to all nodes in a graph, is the graph processed as a whole somehow, or are we basically iterating the same GNN over all the nodes one-by-one.
Toy examples on the internet rarely involve larger graphs, so what I've seen is that they treat this like batches, and all nodes are processed together, concurrently, yet, not as a ""whole"". Given a larger graph (1000s of nodes), surely the GNN must be iterated over them, right? Which would mean, that we can scale GNNs to very large graphs too, as the size of the GNN layers wouldn't scale with the size of the graph, would it?

Choosing and Designing Decay Types for Epsilon-Greedy Exploration in Reinforcement Learning,"
I am working on a reinforcement learning project that involves epsilon-greedy exploration. I have two questions regarding the choice between linear and exponential decay for epsilon, and the appropriate design of the decay constant in the exponential case.

How do we determine whether to use linear decay or exponential decay for the epsilon-greedy exploration mechanism in reinforcement learning?
When using exponential decay, how should we design the decay constant? Different decay constants determine the shape of the curve. In linear decay, we can use the epsilon_decay parameter to determine the shape, but in exponential decay, the relationship between epsilon_decay and the shape is harder to imagine.

I understand that there may not be a single answer for these questions, and I welcome a wide range of discussions on this topic.

# Calculate epsilon values for each step
exp_epsilon_values = [[exponential_epsilon_decay(step, epsilon_decay=epsilon_decay_rate) for step in range(n_steps)] for epsilon_decay_rate in epsilon_decay_rates]
lin_epsilon_values = [[linear_epsilon_decay(step, epsilon_decay=epsilon_decay_rate) for step in range(n_steps)] for epsilon_decay_rate in epsilon_decay_rates]

In linear_epsilon_decay, the epsilon_decay parameter corresponds to the moment when the decay reaches epsilon_end, but in exponential_epsilon_decay, the epsilon_decay parameter has a less direct relationship with when it reaches epsilon_end.

What are the reasons to belief AGI will not be dangerous?,"
We are in the middle of an ongoing debate about the safety of AGI and our current approach towards this technology. As summary, some quotes from a recent article from Time magazine:

Many researchers[...] expect that the most likely result of building a
superhumanly smart AI, under anything remotely like the current
circumstances, is that literally everyone on Earth will die. Not as in
“maybe possibly some remote chance,” but as in “that is the obvious
thing that would happen.”


Without [...] precision and preparation, the most likely outcome is AI
that does not do what we want, and does not care for us nor for
sentient life in general.

Outline for the way to superintelligence and where it can go wrong

Intelligence is subtrate independent, i.e. matter can contain intelligence (brain), ergo a silicon computer can contain intelligence
The evolution of intelligence in the brain is extremely slow (biological evolution). Silicon based AI could recursively self-improve extremely fast and natural limits for intelligence are unlikely to be anywhere close to human level. (Keywords: Singularity, Seed-AI, Intelligence Explosion, etc)
Large jumps in intelligence are known to cause original, ""hard coded"" goals to disappear, e.g.: Human beings - as product of optimizing for inclusive genetic fitness - have been ""trained on"" increasing the number of own copies of functioning systemns with their own DNA - yet we are using birth control and typically it is not priority #1 to donate sperm.


Further complication: At some point (self improving seed-AI) it is not possible to use ""trial and error"": The choice is between ""sucessfull alignment on the first try"" or ""an unaligned superintelligence appears"", which in one way or another is catastrophic and many believe - with a probability bordering on certainty - leads to: human extinction.

The debate could improve with a somewhat central place to collect and sort the various positions / reasons on this topic - for which ai.StackExchange is formidable infrastructure, so:

Given $H=(h_1, h_2, ... h_n)$, a sequence of hidden bidirectional LSTM states, each of dimension $2u$, they try to encode the sentence into a fixed length vector. They do so by weighting the hidden states according to the probabilities (weights) vector $a$ defined as
$a = softmax(W_{s_2}tanh(W_{s_1}H^T))$
This can be read as a multi layer perceptron, $A$, operating on vectors of size $2u$, with a single layer of activation, with activation function $tanh$, and output size of 1. $A$'s output units are log probabilities, meaning ""how likely is timestamp $i$ to be important for the sentence embedding"".
$A$ is then used on the $n$ hidden states, $H$, to obtain $n$ weights, one for each hidden state $h_i$.
Then they go on to extend this from dimension $1$ to $r$.
This is all well, but I fail to see what good this $A$ actually does - it does not use any relationship between two different states $h_i, h_j, i \ne j$ other than that already found by the LSTM, thus (in my mind,) defeating the purpose.
I expected something like the original attention - creating a $nxn$ matrix, and have some MLP $a(h_i, h_j)$ calculate each cell, thus encoding probability of the relationship between the cells. This was not done here.

My questions

Is this really the self attention mentioned throughout ""attention is all you need""? if not, please refer me to the correct paper
Did I understand this paper correctly, and indeed other than the LSTM, there are no relationships between the different time stamps, thus defeating the purpose of encoding the sentence better than the LSTM? [we could just add another layer into the LSTM, isn't it the same or better?]
Please explain the point of this paper. Adding a global MLP on all LSTM states? That's it?
Why only a single layer? why $tanh$? why not just a single vector of
size $1x2h$ and no activation at all?

$$ delta = reward[t] + (gamma * valueNewState[t] * done[t]) - valueOldState[t]$$
Such as in this article. I am wondering why we multiply by done[t] indicating for the last step in the epoch we take reward only and not the value of the current state.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'proximal-policy-optimization']","done[t] indicates whether the state at timestep t was terminal or not.It is used to say when or not to bootstrap (i.e. estimate) the value V(s) of a state: we bootstrap when done[t] = False, providing an estimate for the future discounted reward that the agent should get in expectation (this is also useful when the episode is artificially truncated but not really terminated.) If true, the state at time t is terminal and so its value V(state[t]) should be zero, because the agent landed in a terminal state that ""absorbs"" the future rewards."
Transfer Learning for Solar Energy Production Forecasting with LSTM: Generalized vs. Specialized Models,"
I am working on a solar energy production forecasting problem using LSTM multi-step models to predict 1/4/8h ahead of solar energy production for different solar installations. Our goal is to help clients optimize their energy utilization by trading with their neighbours or respective Microgrids.
I have clustered households into groups such as small generators, medium generators, and large generators. I am currently developing a multi-household model for each cluster using TensorFlow's LSTM multi-step model tutorial.
To improve prediction accuracy and provide a more personalized approach, I would like to explore transfer learning to create specialized single-household models based on the generalized multi-household models.
Multi-Household Model (Generalized Model)
The dataset consists of 160 time series and includes weather features such as hour, day, month, temperature, DHI, DNI, GHI, precipitation, and solar zenith angle. The model learns from multiple similar households.
To better visualize the dataset, here is an example:

Note: These features related to the weather would be an average of the district that these houses exist in.
This current setup utilizes TS_0 to TS_N as examples to learn from each other since their solar installations are similar and should therefore yield similar amounts of electricity. I can then use TS_X as an output label to predict, thereby getting a prediction for each household while maintaining some learning from other household examples.
Single-Household Model (Specialized Model)
I want to create a specialized model for each household by using transfer learning from the generalized model. This specialized model will incorporate household-specific features such as solar capacity, number of habitants, solar installation angle/direction, and town-specific weather parameters.
Objective
The goal is to create generalized models that can help train specialized models for better accuracy for each household while allowing easy onboarding of new users.
Business Case for Generalized vs Specific Model
The generalized model would be trained for general locations across a country for certain solar installations (this would be trained with ongoing customer data). The more specific single-household model would enable (in theory) to have more personalized predictions for your specific solar installation setup and location.
A generalized model approach would enable the solar installation company to be able to onboard users more easily - simply add a new customer to the generalized model that better fits a specific household cluster.
A single-household model would make it more difficult to onboard a new user as you would need a buffer period to gather customer data before being able to train a specific ML model for them.
Problem
The problem with the single-household model is that the household-specific features might be constant across the dataset and not very meaningful. Adding these features in the multi-household model would lead to a high-dimensionality problem where we would have a feature for each timeseries.
I would like to ask for recommendations on the following:

How can I create an architecture that goes from generalized models to more specific models while being able to introduce valuable additional information specific to a single household?
If I opt for a multi-household generalized model solution, how can I include more specific feature information for each time series without running into dimensionality problems?
If I choose a single-household model solution (a model for every single client), how can I ensure good predictions, considering the model wouldn't have access to other time series examples within its tier?

There is a limit to the amount of single-household data we could acquire since some of these may be more recent customers and won’t have multi-year data available

Can models like chatGPT learn functions with infinite domain or range,"
Lets assume two types of prompt:
A fixed prompt for which reasonable responses can be infinite. For example:

> output a random number
> output a palindrome

A prompt that can slightly varied to get different output each time which reasonable mapping. Quotes mark what will be varied.
> what is the double of ""2""
> echo ""xyz""

Now that the network is trained on finite data and has finite parameters, does it inherently   prevent it from perfectly answering these questions each time.
If yes, can a tiny network be handcrafted to model an infinite domain function and its only the ""learning from data"" part that prevents it from learning such functions.
","['neural-networks', 'deep-neural-networks', 'chatgpt']","It depends on the design of the model, of course.The overall design of a GPT model is like this: the last certain number of tokens (e.g. 2048) are passed into a neural network which outputs probabilities for the next token. Then a next token is chosen according to the probabilities. This repeats until something. So it can't see more than a certain number of tokens back - and that's the fault of how it's designed. If you ask it to generate a longer palindrome, it will eventually forget the beginning of the palindrome and also forget the instruction to generate a palindrome. However, if you ask it to generate random numbers, as long as the inputs are random numbers it will probably keep generating more random numbers.Other kinds of models exist, like RNNs, which process one token at a time and remember some data between tokens. Theoretically, an RNN could keep passing information down the chain indefinitely. In practice, they do not. Also, nobody has made one work as well as GPT.Transformer models, the precursor to GPT, worked like GPT but they did have separate prompt and output strings. The input is the last certain number of output tokens, plus all the input tokens. This kind of model would not forget the instruction to generate a palindrome, but it would forget the beginning of the palindrome after a while."

It allows you to train on already collected data that you could otherwise not use.An off-policy algorithm can be used to ""re-interpret"" data that was collected earlier while running a worse policy.

(Instead of learning to anticipate those random actions and mitigate.)But in practice, if you can cheaply generate new training episodes (e.g. with a fast simulator), an off-policy algorithm may make the learning more complicated (slower) without any benefit.

"Is it possible for original Vision Transformer (ViT) to do fine-grained semanantic segmentation? if so, how?","
As far as I know, in the original ViT, the image is first divided to a fixed size of patch (16x16, for example) then they are flattened and treated as tokens and fed into Transformer.
Without using later more recent techniques (such as Hierarchical patch merging in Swin transformer), I feel like it is not possible to do the fine-grained segmentation at all, the best it can do is to label the whole token (with 16x16 pixel) as one class, since the model no longer understands any spatial information in the token.
Is my understanding correct? I know that it didnt do as well as Swin Transformer which use more fine-grained hierachical patch merging. But can ViT still selectively label some pixels in one patch as one class and the other pixels as another class?

In the age of artificial intelligence, super-intelligent machines like GPT have become a reality, leading to the question of how to quantify or measure their intelligence. While IQ tests are widely used to measure human intelligence, could a similar approach be used to assess the intelligence of machines? Is it possible to compare the intelligence of a machine to that of a human in this context, given that machines possess certain cognitive abilities and limitations that differ from those of humans? Additionally, what are some alternative methods for evaluating machine intelligence, and how do they differ from traditional IQ tests used for humans? Finally, what implications might arise from the development of super-intelligent machines, both in terms of how we measure and compare intelligence and in terms of their impact on society as a whole?
","['open-ai', 'gpt', 'large-language-models', 'intelligence-quotient']","tl;dr– Yes, we can give machines IQ-tests.  And we basically already do, just often skipping the last step of explicitly recognizing an IQ-score.Sure, we can give machines IQ-tests.To be clear, IQ tests are basically just:Create a test that assigns higher scores to test-takers with higher intelligence.Test a bunch of intelligences and score their exams.Rank the test-takers from lowest-to-highest.Assign each test-taker a percentile-ranking.Calculate IQ by casting the percentile-rankings to a normal-curve with a median of 100 and a standard-deviation of 15.Equation's $\text{IQ} = \sqrt{2} \operatorname{erf}^{-1}{\left(2p - 1\right)} ~~ p \in \left(0, 1\right) \, ,$ where $p$ is the percentile-rank (e.g., $p=0.5$ for a median-percentile of 50%).On WolframAlpha: $\texttt{100 + 15 * sqrt(2) * erf^(-1) (2 *}\underbrace{\texttt{ 0.5 }}_{p}\texttt{- 1)}$.On Microsoft-Excel: $\texttt{=100+15*NORM.S.INV(}\underbrace{\texttt{0.5}}_{p}\texttt{)} \,.$Folks basically already do this with various AI-models, e.g. when ranking their relative performance on a series of tasks, just don't normally do Steps 4 or 5.Basically just give both humans and machines the same test and rank them, then calculate.

Redundancy of Value-Projection-matrix in Multi-headed attention in Transformer model,"
In the original transformer paper ""Attention is all you need"" in section 3.2.2 it is written:
Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries, we found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned linear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of queries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as depicted in Figure 2.
I am wondering why you need to project the values h times if you concatenate and project them once again in the end. It seems to me that this just results in two matrices being learned that are multiplied with each other. This should have the same expressiveness as one matrix. So, in my understanding you could just leave away the h projection steps and simply do the final projection. Am I missing something?

"Why LLMs and RNNs learn so fast during inference but, ironically, are so slow during training?","
Why LLMs learn so fast during inference, but, ironically, are so slow during training? That is, if you teach an AI a new concept in a prompt, it will learn and use the concept perfectly and flawless, through the whole prompt, after just one shot. Yet, if you train it in just a single sample, it will not influence its behavior at all - it will essentially forget. Why can't RNNs use whatever is happening during inference, rather than gradient descent, to update its weights and, thus, learn? In other words, can't the attention mechanism itself be used to update weights, rather than some cost function?
","['recurrent-neural-networks', 'meta-learning', 'inference', 'large-language-models']","As pointed out by others, what you call ""learning"" at inference, is nothing more than providing more context. The model can indeed memorize in its short-term, but it is only working for the current task at hand. You suggest that we could make a model with an infinite contextual memory, but then it would mix up all tasks together. It would literally be like if you had to recite all the numbers you ever calculated or counted or saw before starting a new calculation.Hence, contextualization is only useful for short-term tasks, and it works only thanks to the slow learning phase you have to do the first time around, which is more formally called the ""convergence process"".So, what you are looking for is in fact to make the convergence process faster, and more precisely a one-shot or zero-shot learning. If you don't just look at LLMs (Large Language Models) and RNNs (Recursive Neural Networks), there are a lot of other AI models that can do one-shot or even zero-shot learning, such as memory models like grippon-berrou neural network. One-shot learning can learn the first time they see an example, and generalize over it. Zero-shot learning can even learn without being presented some examples, by generalizing from others, or by transferring knowledge from another field.For example, Text2Video-Zero is a recently published text to video generator, which did NOT learn from any video, but instead reused the weights from Stable Diffusion trained on still images. What this algorithm does is that it can cleverly generalize learning from still images into a coherent sequence of images with the same style, hence mimicking motion, with no additional cost. Of course, it's not completely zero-shot, because it has to be provided with a Stable Diffusion weights model first, but essentially zero-shot learning means that you can reuse one model that was made for one purpose for another purpose, for free (ie, you can directly infer, no need to re-learn anything).Technically, One/Zero-shot learning typically requires another kind of architecture, more brain-like (ie, with discrete 0/1 synaptic weights). The long convergence processes are usually required by networks using floating weights (ie, the McCulloch-Pitts neurons). Because floating weights are not at all biologically plausible, they are a mathematical abstraction that synthesizes several biological functions of biological neural networks into fewer, more amenable to programming abstractions.Likewise, convolution layers in CNNs (convolutional neural networks) are another abstraction of how biological systems integrate big populations of neurons, but here we can use a much smaller population of artificial neurons, and use more optimized instructions sets to do the same work as the brain does. You have to keep in mind that for a lot of purposes in AI, current computers are much less efficient than the human brain, hence why all these highly synthetic reproductions, more optimized for the machine but very remote from how real biological systems work, are necessary. Here, long convergence (ie, long learning) is an unavoidable artifact from how we model our artificial neurons and synapses, with floating numbers instead of discrete (binary), and with mathematical functions for integration instead of analog biological integration (which is both more fine grained and simpler than numerical functions, see for example the videos by Veritasium about analog computers, biological systems have similar properties and advantages).RNNs are a kind of the opposite approach and problem, because they use a more biologically plausible property, recursivity, but the problem is that we have a hard time defining artificial systems that are efficient at learning recursive networks. So here, it's the opposite of what can be observed with CNNs and LLMs: the long convergence is due to current science providing inefficient learning algorithms when recursivity is involved. The last few years saw tremendous progress on this, with very clever algorithms, but it's still very far from how biological systems can neatly manage recursivity.All that is to say that, to answer directly your question, why the current LLM and RNN models can't learn in zero/one-shot from the get-go: it's because nobody found a way to mathematically formulate such a model. Maybe someone will be able to in the near future, maybe it will take decades, but for now, it's the slow convergence LLM and RNN models that work, it's the ones that provide you with the hyped tools such as ChatGPT.Personally, I think we won't get there until we find how analog biological neural system work, and then we need to develop new computer technologies to mimic those. There is already a lot of work towards these, with biological neurons reprogramming by ARN signalling or mixing them with silicon neurons, but it's still far from the ""real deal"". There are at least hundreds of different types of neurons, and there are many other neural cells types with not completely understood functions. We are far from fully understanding biological neural systems, but progress is continuous and steady.Disclaimer: I am both an AI researcher and a clinical neuroscientist and I studied some computational neuroscience./EDIT: A small update to extend my explanation above for the technically and philosophically inclined ones: learning at its most fundamental level can be defined as the ability of a system to modify its structure to reflect some input signal, and memory being the system itself that can modify its structure according to input signals. In biological systems, there are two types of memory: short-term and long-term. Recent artificial recursive neural network models try to mimic this, with the very famous LSTM model (Long-Short Term Memory), itself a precursor of the GPT models. By convention, in machine learning we call ""learning"" the tweaking of the weights, ie, the long-term memory. But there is also indeed a short-term memory which has its own weights, but AI researchers don’t call this process learning, although it technically is by all standards, the only difference being the exact method used and the length of time the memory is retained.And just like there are models that modify/learn short-term memory at inference but not long-term memory, there are models that tweak their long-term memory at inference, notably bayesian models, as often used for weather forecasting.So why LLMs and RNNs learn fast during inference is because they are designed to only learn short-term memory, so that the big lot of weights of long-term memory were learnt beforehand. But future improvements of the tech may very well allow to design networks that also learn long-term memory ""online"", in real-time, in a stochastic manner with a guarantee of convergence."

How do I obtain a feature map of an arbitrarily size during atrous convolution? (DeepLab V2),"
I am studying the Deeplab family of architectures. The general workflow is clear to me, but there are some technical details that I'm not understanding. In the Deeplab V2 the authors state that:
""Atrous convolution allows us to explicitly control the resolution at
which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks. [...] This algorithm (Atrous convolution) allows us to compute the responses
of any layer at any desirable resolution.""
Shouldn't the resolution be determined by the parameters of kernel size, stride, padding and rate (the latter introduced in atrous convolution)?
As the rate increases, the activation map should shrink as in the following example.

I interpreted it this way: they implicitly introduce padding that keeps the activation map unchanged as the rate increases:

Are my assumptions correct?
The second thing I did not understand is how they add up the results of the parallel convolutions in the ASPP layer. The results of the convolutions are processed separately and independently with two 1x1 convolutions, so the resolution (H x W) of the activation map is not further modified. If my assumptions are correct, then the sum can be made (all the convolutions produce maps with the same H x W). If my assumptions are wrong, then I have not understood how the sum of maps with different dimensions is carried out.

How does Position embeddings work in Vision Transformer,"
I'm a bit confused how the position embedding in happened to each patch in the transformer. I thought Ideally we'd want each patch to have a value of (1, 2, 3, 4....) to describe the position of the patch in the image. but from the implementation here there do something like this:

Assume we have a patch embedding output (1, 256, 768); corresponding to (batch, num_patches, position_embedding). since we have 256 patches, then can't our network understand that each patch is in the position of its index value?

The deep ensemble paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.01474.pdf introduces proper scoring rules for ensembles of NNs. Turns out that the likelihood is always a proper scoring rule.
For regression tasks, we can then use the gaussian NLL, which includes information about the output variance of the network and optimises the quadratic term while still accounting for that. The advantage here is quite clear to me.
But I don't understand how deep ensembles are different than just regular ensembles for classification tasks. In either, each NN is still trained independently on the binary cross entropy loss, and then the prediction is averaged. So (apart from the adversarial training introduced in the paper above), what's different between the two?

With each RGB pixel storing 3 parameters we could have snapshot of the situation stored in an 12 pixel image with room to spare.

LLM-like architecture capable of dynamically learning from its own output,"
Language Learning Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in quick learning during inference. They can effectively grasp a concept from a single example and generate relevant outputs. However, a noticeable limitation of LLMs is their inability to work on large-scale projects, such as generating a cohesive book, due to context size constraints. One potential solution is enabling LLMs to learn from their own outputs, but the learning rate during the training phase is significantly slower than the rate at which they absorb and process concepts during inference.
I am interested in exploring the possibility of an architecture that allows for fast and efficient learning, enabling the AI to dynamically and incrementally train from its own output. This would facilitate the production of large-scale cohesive outputs that surpass context limitations. Although RNNs like RWKV theoretically offer ""infinite context size,"" it is not practically useful as the model tends to ""forget"" concepts that are distant in the prompt.
Human learning involves continuous adjustments of synapses while working on a problem, which seems like an ideal approach to emulate. Are there any existing or proposed architectures that incorporate this mechanism, allowing for dynamic learning from generated outputs and the creation of large-scale cohesive content in LLMs?

What else beyond convnets is needed to detect sameness in a Bongard problem?,"
In her book Artificial Intelligence - A Guide for Thinking Humans, Melanie Mitchell explains that convolutional neural networks fail to build a useful model for these two classes of images, yielding chance classification for unseen images.

Image from: https://www.foundalis.com/res/bps/bongard/p057.htm
This surprises me because convolutional networks look very close to the idea embedded in the images: they can detect an object regardless of its position. If splitted in two convenient regions, and taking any of them as a filter, the other region would be perfectly detected in the sameness case, and would yield a low match in the different class.
How should this additional step of splitting be added to the convnet classifier to be able to model sameness?

Can I reduce computation by only predicting response tokens in a transformer and still get the same gradients?,"
I have been looking at the source code of the Stanford Alpaca model and I believe that during inference, the whole instruction + response data is fed into the model normally. Then the instruction part of the label is masked with IGNORE_INDEX to prevent gradient calculation on the instruction.
But I believe that in the transformer network, after the attention blocks and before the last head layer, it should be possible to take only the (embedded) tokens corresponding to the response parts from contexts and avoid predicting from the tokens corresponding to the instruction part altogether. This could potentially save computation, especially when the instruction part is long or when training on back-and-forth conversations, similar to interactions with ChatGPT. So my question is:


Is the gradients calculated by these two approaches the same?

I actually tried to ask GPT-4 about this. Initially, he suggested that my approach would lose some information, but later changed his opinion when I asked him further. Would my approach indeed result in a loss of information or any other drawbacks?


Is the saving, if possible, worth the effort of modifying the model's source code?

Since the change would only affect one matrix multiplication, which is already efficiently computed, I'm unsure if it's worth the trouble. Furthermore, I only know a little bitPyTorch and would definitely struggle with implementing modifications to complicated models written in other frameworks like TensorFlow or JAX.

Is it possible to apply entity fixed effects to a firth logit test?,"
All,
Currently working with a large dataset (~1.6 million observations) with a relatively low number of rare events (~600ish). To summarize, I'm looking at the impact of 7 foreign-policy related independent variables to see the effect on whether a country, in any given year (1816 - 2000), initiates a militarized action against another country (i.e., the outcome variable is binary: either the country attacked or didn't).
Since the binary outcome variable is only 1 in ~600 cases, I'm using a firth logit test, but I think I need to account for country fixed effects. So my question is: does anyone know if it is possible to add entity fixed effects to a firth logit test?
If yes, wonderful! I'd like to add country fixed effects to my model in Stata (version 17). Thanks in advance for any and all insight!

How does a LLM (transformer) pick words from its vocabulary?,"
I have a very rough understanding of the ""attention/self attention"" mechanism of transformer models and how this can be used to process a set of word vectors provided as an input/prompt to the encoder of a network and how this will produce ""attention weights"" for the word vectors based on positional encodings and some other learnable parameters (key/query/value transforms). And then these can be ""fed"" to the decoder part of the network which will also consider word vectors that have been produced by the decoder so far and influence word selection by paying special attention to particular word combinations.
However LLMs clearly produce words in their output/response that do not occur anywhere inside the ""prompt"" text. So they must be using these ""attention weights"" to consider words from a wider vocabulary, which could be quite large.
Is it the case that the decoder ""considers"" each possible word in it's entire vocabulary when producing an output word? For example I'm imagining an input layer to a NN with several thousand nodes (one per word vector in dictionary) on the input then these are ""combined"" through some operation with attention weights (from the encoder and decoder ""attention section"") producing values for most word vectors that are very low (so below the threshold for some activation function) but each word is still ""considered"" to an extent? Or are only a subset of words considered in some way?

Is manual binding output to input also an AI?,"
I know AI is primarly training a machine by samples of input-output in order it would learn itself about relations between the input and the output.
What if I manually add the relations? Is that still can be called a type of AI? If so, what type is that within the context of AI classifying?
In other words, does manually bound inputs and outputs belong to some ""official"" sort of modern AI due to specific case(s) when we need such a manual binding instead of training a machine? Or AI is exclusively creating relations by machine learning only?
For example, if I save some text notes (output) and add multiple tags manually to each of the notes in order to find a note in the future by a few tags inputted (input), is such a search system a type of AI? Or I can call it just ""intelligent"", but not AI-like? Where is the ""official"" difference?
","['terminology', 'data-preprocessing', 'search']","AI is not exclusive to machine learning. Back in the early days of the AI, in the 1960's or thereabouts, they were programming rules-based systems. A lot of work was done on manipulating facts and using combinations of facts to derive new facts. In 1972 the Prolog language was created which does exactly this - the programmer defines a bunch of rules and then the interpreter finds ways to answer queries using the rules. (E.g. ""Tom is a cat. All cats are animals. What animals exist?"" -> ""Tom"" [but written in Prolog and not in English])There was also work on natural language processing - you can see e.g. SHRDLU. It was like ChatGPT but it only knew about stacking blocks and it was written in 1968 using Lisp. PUT THE BLUE CYLINDER ON THE RED CUBE. WHERE IS THE BLUE CYLINDER?. Today we're quite impressed to see ChatGPT answer this, but it's also easy to see how it could be done simply by adding enough rules to the system. SHRDLU would not only answer it, but also do it with a robot arm. Oh look, they also made DALL-E in 1985.Nowadays, AI and Machine Learning are near-synonymous, because the other AI stuff - such as natural language processing - is no longer called ""AI"".Your tag search system is not AI in any sense of the word - it's just a tag search system.

Filter in the Single Shot Detector,"
Let's say I want to implement a single shot detector. When I get a feature mal as an input, I will use a 3x3 filter for prediction for each cell.
Let's say we have 5 classes with 6 ancors, I would have to create (5+4)*6(anchors) filters. That would be an output of 54 feature maps for prediction.
When I use them as input for the next layer and have a conv2d with 54 input and 54 output channels isn't that against the single shot detector architecture. Don't I have to use one feature maps again? Because in the end I should use 5 or six feature maps.
But what happens to the convolutional layer with the 54 outputs? When I don't put there outputs into another layer they won't get updated during back propagation

Looking for scalable spatiotemporal clustering algorithm or scalable mixed features data clustering algorithms,"
I want to cluster the Porto taxi dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pkdd-15-taxi-trip-time-prediction-ii/data . After processing the dataset, I have a dataset which consists of temporal features (hour, day of week, holiday or not), numerical features, categorical features (like whether the taxi was ordered from a taxi stand or randomly on street etc.) and lastly trajectories (series latitude longitude GPS points the taxi traveled along).
Because my dataset consists of many different type of features, I can't directly cluster using an algorithm like K-Means or DBSCAN and choosing one distance metric only. So, I defined custom distance matrices for each of these categories. My plan was to use DBSCAN with custom distance metric, which would be a weighted sum of all the four different distance metrices. However, as I have around 1.5 million trips to cluster, simply taking sklearn's DBSCAN function with metric=precomputed fails due to memory issues.
I have found this paper: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/fdf1bc5669e8ff5ba45d02fded729feb-Abstract.html which suggests a variant of DBSCAN, which lowers the complexity from O(n²) to O(nlog(n)). The implementation of this variant is not available, so I implemented it in python. However, in my case it takes a lot of time, even to try to cluster for numerical features only is not stopping after 1 day.
My question is: I have been working on this for so long and am very frustrated regarding what clustering approach I should take. I have looked at spatio-temporal clustering algorithms (which would only cluster based on the trajectory information, but that's a good start too!), but they all seem to be claiming that they work well for datasets up to about 200.000 dataset points (for example ST-DBSCAN).
Am I missing something? Is there no scalable clustering algorithm for spatiotemporal clustering or clustering with mixed features? I appreciate any help or hint! Thank you so much already!

What's the most efficient way of performing batched training of Causal Language Models?,"
I have seen a number of ways to train (yes, train, not fine-tune) these models efficiently with batches. I will illustrate these techniques with the following example dataset and context window:
Context window:
   -----------------
Data samples:
1. ###
2. ################
3. ####
4. ##############
5. ########
6. #########

Suppose we have a batch size of 2. Our pad token is x
First technique: Vanilla Padding
Context window:
   -----------------
batch 1:
1. ###xxxxxxxxxxxxx
2. ################

batch 2:
3. ####xxxxxxxxxx
4. ##############

batch 3: 
5. ########x
6. #########

Second technique: Bucketed Padding
Samples of similar lengths are batched together to minimise the number of pad tokens
Context window:
   -----------------
batch 1:
1. ###x
3. ####

batch 2:
2. ################
4. ##############xx

batch 3: 
5. ########x
6. #########

this is uniform length batching described in this blogpost and referred to as bucketed random sampling in this paper.
Third technique: Concatenating samples
In this technique, we concatenate samples, separating them with a EOS token (E) until they reach the context length. In this way, we have no padding tokens, and the entire context length is used. The attention mask keeps track of where the EOS tokens occur.
Context window:
   -----------------
batch 1:
   ###E############# (1 and part of 2)
batch 2:
   ###E####E######## (rest of 2, 3 and part of 4)
batch 3:
   ######E########E# (rest of 4, 5, part of 6)
batch 4:
   ######## (rest of 6)

This technique is referenced at 2:28 of this video from this huggingface tutorial.
With this technique, we reduce the number of batches, and only have to pad the final batch if necessary. However, it is unclear to me whether this is ""allowed"" for causal language modelling, as it is unclear whether this will cause the causal attention mechanism to attend to tokens from previous samples, only ignoring the EOS token (instead of everything before it)

Of these 3 techniques, which is the most memory efficient? Which is the most commonly used?

Q learning: How to create output layer in which actions are combinations of multiple sub-actions,"
Suppose in my example I want an agent to learn a behavior that is made up of a combination of actions.
So consider the following example with a tamagotchi like game: There are 5 pets and 3 actions that can be taken for each pet (give food, give water, play).
Now I know that in the standard approach, the DQN network would be such that the output is of shape 5x3 = 15. But for a larger space of pets and possible actions this would become unfeasible. So is there an adaption of deep q learning in which I could use a network that has only 3+5=8 output layers and treats the selection of the pet and the action independently?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'q-learning', 'dqn']","What you're describing is known as a composite action space (or a factorisable action space). The key assumption is that the action space can be factorised in sub-action spaces, i.e. $\mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A}_1 \times ... \times \mathcal{A}_N$.As far as I know, this is a relatively new area in terms of research contributions. The two papers that come to mind are action branching networks and Decoupled Q-Network.The latter is likely to be the easiest to implement. Rather than flattening your sub-action spaces into an action space that consists of very many primitive actions and having a DQN provide an output value for the many different possibilities, instead you have $N$ output heads for each sub-action space. Where a DQN would be a function $f : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{A}|}$, the decoupled network would be $N$ functions $f_i : \mathcal{S} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{A}_i|}$. If we refer to the these sub-functions as utility functions, i.e. $U_i(s, a_i)$, then we can obtain the Q-value as $Q(s, a_1, ..., a_N) = \sum_{i=1}^N U_i(s, a_i)$. This way, the size of the spaces we need to learn values for grows linearly with the number of sub-action spaces rather than exponentially."
Does MSE loss function work in NN training for predicting values between 0-1?,"
In a NN regression problem, considering that MSE is squaring the error and the error is between 0 and 1 would it be pointless to use MSE as our loss function during model training?
For example:
MSE = (y_pred - y_true) ^ 2 

@ Expected model output range [0, 1]:
MSE = (0.1 - 0.01) ^ 2 = 0.0081

// Significantly larger error is less pronounced in the MSE output
MSE = (0.1 - 0.0001) ^ 2 = 0.00998001


@ Expected model output range [10, 20]:
MSE = (10 - 12) ^ 2 = 4

// Significantly larger error is more pronounced in the MSE output
MSE = (10 - 20) ^ 2 = 100

If it’s indeed useless for that range, would using RMSE allow us to use this loss function at 0-1 range to benefit from its outlier sensitivity during training or is there another loss that would mimic the effect of MSE for values between 0 and 1?
","['deep-learning', 'loss', 'mean-squared-error']","Depending on what you want to do, there are advantages to other loss functions (crossentropy) and other regression models (beta regression), but there is not necessarily a reason to dislike MSE as a loss function when the target is between $0$ and $1$, no. For instance, it might be that you know your outcome has a Gaussian distribution with a mean between $0$ and $1$. Then what you’re doing by minimizing MSE is equivalent to maximum likelihood estimation, which has many nice statistical properties.From calculus, $f(x)$ and $\sqrt{f(x)}$ are minimized by the same $x$. Thus, RMSE and MSE are equivalent as loss functions in the sense that whatever minimized one minimizes the other."
"In the proof of Neural Tangent Kernel stays constant in infinite width limit, why the norm of the dual mapping operator equals operator norm of kernel","
For a fixed distribution $p^{in}$  on the input space $ \mathbb{R}^{n_0}$,
consider a function space $\mathcal{F}$ defined as $\{{f: \mathbb{R}^{n_0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_L}}\}$.
On this space, consider the seminorm $\|\cdot\|_{p^{in}}$,
defined  in terms of the bilinear form $\langle f, g\rangle_{p^{in}}=\mathbb{E}_{x \sim {p^{in}}}\left[f(x)^T g(x)\right]$.
A multi-dimensional kernel $K$ is a function $\mathbb{R}^{n_0} \times \mathbb{R}^{n_0} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n_L \times n_L}$, which  maps any pair $(x, x')$ to an $n_L \times n_L$ matrix such that $K\left(x, x^{\prime}\right)=K\left(x^{\prime}, x\right)^T$. Such a kernel defines a bilinear map on $\mathcal{F}$:
$$
\langle f, g\rangle_K:=\mathbb{E}_{x, x^{\prime} \sim p^{i n}}\left[f(x)^T K\left(x, x^{\prime}\right) g\left(x^{\prime}\right)\right]
$$
Denote by $\mathcal{F}^*$ the dual of $\mathcal{F}$  with respect to $p^{in}$, i.e. the set of linear forms $\mu: \mathcal{F} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$  of the form $\mu=\langle d, \cdot\rangle_{p^{i n}}$ for some $d \in \mathcal{F}$.  Using the fact that the partial application of the kernel $K_{i, \cdot}(x, \cdot)$ is a function in $\mathcal{F}$, we can define a map $\Phi_K: \mathcal{F}^* \rightarrow \mathcal{F}$  mapping a dual element $\mu=\langle d, \cdot\rangle_{p^{i n}}$  to the function  $f_\mu=\Phi_K(\mu)$ with values:
$$
f_{\mu, i}(x)=\mu K_{i, \cdot(x, \cdot)}=\left\langle d, K_{i, \cdot}(x, \cdot)\right\rangle_{p^{i n}}
$$
Additionally, define the operator norm on kernels:
$$
\|K\|_{o p}=\max _{\|f\|_{p^{i n}} \leq 1}\|f\|_K=\max _{\|f\|_{p^{i n}} \leq 1} \sqrt{\mathbb{E}_{x, x^{\prime}}\left[f(x)^T K\left(x, x^{\prime}\right) f\left(x^{\prime}\right)\right]}
$$
Now, my question is, in section A.2 of the paper Neural Tangent Kernel: Convergence and Generalization in Neural Networks, it mentions that ""the operator norm of $\Phi_{\Theta_{\infty}^{(L)}}$ is equal to $\left\|\Theta_{\infty}^{(L)}\right\|_{o p}$"", where $\Theta_{\infty}^{(L)}$ is the limiting neural tangent kernel.
Why this is true?
I'm probably missing something obvious here but any leads would be much appreciated!

Recognize patterns within random sequences,"
I am familiar with ANNs  as I studied them back in the days for regression and currently I'm working with CNN's for image recognition. But recently I was reading more about pattern recognition in sequences and also sequence prediction, so I end up reading about RNN's and more especifically about LSTM.
However, I realized all the examples I read always use a more or less easy predictable dataset like a normal numerical sequence (1,2,3,4..) or a kind of wave form that repeats some specific shape every X samples. In these cases the RNNs can not only fit a good regression on training dataset but also make a reasonably good prediction for the future. On the other side, with more random dataset it mostly can only fit the existing dataset with a good regression but not really predict anything very well due to the random nature of the data, which is understandable.
The question I am then making myself is: what is the best approach to tackle a problem in between those extremes? Say we have a limited weather dataset (limited in the sense of not extensive enough to make good predictions) as an example. Even if the dataset is not complete enough so we can make general good predictions, it is still possible that one can find some specific patterns within the dataset that may happen kind of randomly, namely, that almost everytime we see a sequence of 2-3 days raising the temperature together with humidity and wind speed, it rains (just as a simple example). So even though our model might not learn to make a good day-to-day prediction, it could understand that this kind of pattern happens every once in a while, so whenever it recognizes this small sequence, it can say with some good probability that it will rain. Another example would be analyzing traffic data on a network. You might not be able to predict what is being transmitted but you might be able to say, for example, a constant stream of data (video) is about to be transmitted when you see someone has requested data from youtube.com.
In those scenarios, I'm not looking for a model that generally predicts the next step of sequence, but rather to identify within an ""apparent random dataset"" when some small patterns take place. For these cases, is the RNN's (like LSTM) still the best recommendation of model? If yes, is there something one might need to adjust or tune in order to achieve that? I also read a bit about transformers and apparently you can give focus to some specific events in comparison with others. Is this maybe a use case for that?
I hope the question is not broad enough and I'm looking forward for some tips and advices with this regards. Thanks
UPDATE:

when predicting a probability like suggested by maxy, how should I represent the output vector exactly? Having a practical example:

I have 3 features (humidity, temperature and hours of sunshine in a day).
I want to predict the probability of rain on the next day.

So in this case, which I do not want to predict all features, but rather just one of them, how should I design it? I can imagine, from what I understood on the suggestion, I would have something like a LSTM layer, followed probably by a Dense layer and then a Softmax as output layer. To train, I would provide a normalized version of my input (physical values in percentage, degrees and hours) and use a float value between 0.0 and 1.0 as label, where 1.0 is used for the past days that rained and 0.0 for the ones it did not. However this is probably not what was suggested, since I would not be dealing with mean/variance of the temperature, neither with any kind of proability distribution, since my model would then just predict a percentage between 0.0 and 1.0.
Also I am not sure if I follow how to fit step 3 into it. Do you mean using the predicted values to try predicting more steps into the future or as another way of training the model mixing past with predicted data?
Sounds like many questions from my side but I find the approach quite interesting and would like to understand it better to give it a try. But for that, I need to understand how exactly is the data format. If you could use my example above to illustrate what you mean, would be very helpful! Thanks

Role of $f$ Target Network in DDPG,"
I am trying to create a variant of DDPG in MATLAB that has no action-value $\langle Q \rangle$ net, but that instead works with networks $\langle V \rangle, \langle f \rangle, \langle r \rangle$, and also target networks $V^{+}$ and $f^{+}$ (but no $r^{+}$ or $Q^{+}$). Here, $V$ is the value function $V^{\mu} = Q^{\mu}(s, \mu(s))$, i.e., it is simply $Q^{\mu}(s, a)$ when $a$ is chosen to fit the policy $\mu$, $f$ is the state dynamics function and $r$ is the reward. Altogether, $Q^{\mu}(s_t, a_t) = r(s_t, a_t) \Delta t + V^{\mu}(s_{t+\Delta t})$, setting the discount factor $\gamma = 1$.  In the task given, I am instructed to train

$\langle r\rangle$ based on minibatches drawn from a replay buffer, using a loss function that is half the square error $e^{r} = \langle r \rangle (s\_, a\_) - r\_$, where $s\_, a\_, r\_$ are from the buffer.
$\langle f \rangle$ using a loss function that is half the square of $e^{f} = \langle V \rangle(\langle f \rangle (s\_, a\_)) - \langle V \rangle(s_{next}\_)$
$\langle V \rangle$ by using an analogue to the Bellman error for $\langle Q \rangle$

What I do not see in all of this is the need for a target network $f^{+}$. The use of the target network $V^{+}$ arises because $e^f$ and $e^{V}$ admit two instances of the same network $V$–– thus, to simplify things, one can assign the first instance of $V$ to $\langle V \rangle$ and the other to the target $V^{+}$, before ultimately nudging the parameters of $V^{+}$ towards those of $\langle V \rangle.$ But role does $f^{+}$ play?

How can i tinker my neural network to learn stronger on rare events?,"

Most of the time the actual y (label) has the same value (say ~0.2) and only in rare cases the actual y is very different (say 2.0 or -2.0)
After training the neural network obviously performs very well on average by allways predicting (predicted y) a number around 0.2, mostly independant on the input.
However, it is still very bad on predicting when the actual y should be different.
At the moment i am improving the situation by training the neural network mostly on situations where y is far from the average y and filtering out situations where y is close to the average y.

Does changing deep learning model loss function affect the occurence of plateau?,"
If we use two loss functions that are in the same ""units"" (say MAE and RMSE). Should training the same model with these two different loss functions result in plateau happening at a different place?
Say in this particular case our dataset does not have many outliers so there's not much penalizing the outliers.
","['deep-learning', 'training']","If you train the same model with two different loss functions, such as MAE and RMSE, the model may reach a plateau at different places for each loss function. This is because these loss functions have different sensitivities to errors and are optimized differently during training.In your specific case, where there are not many outliers in the dataset, the differences in the training dynamics between MAE and RMSE might be less pronounced. However, it is still possible for the models to reach a plateau at different points, because the two loss functions handle errors differently. The model with RMSE may converge slightly later than the one with MAE because it focuses more on reducing larger errors."
How to calculate the loss for object tracking model,"
I am using a CNN model to detect the location of a tennis ball's center (not bounding box). the output is a 2d tensor after a softmax layer so each cell represent the probebility that this is where the ball center is found.
I am trying to figure out what is the best way to calculate the loss. I tried several methods, the first is comparing it to a tensor that equel 1 in the real location and 0 anywhere else. the problem here is that if the model predict the ball location is one cell a side even though the accurecy is good enough for me, the loss would be like it was complitly wrong. other methods were to give 1 to the real location and all its neighbors but this is not possible to achive if the last layer is softmax (i tried sigmoid but it gave horrble results) or to give a high score to the real location like 0.92 and  0.01 the the neighbors which I am currently using.
Is there a known method how to do it? or should I just try them all?

Adding a Transposition Table to Monte Carlo Tree Search,"
I think I'm having a bit of trouble wrapping my head around how a transposition table functions:
As I understand it you can store a value (simulation result?) for a given game state in this (hash) table and use it instead of a simulation when that game state is encountered again. However, since the simulation is (or at least in my case is) completely random play, I would think that you need to build up a sample size before the result value of the simulation starts meaning anything.
It seems to me that with the way I understand it now, these two principles can't both be achieved simultaneously, so what am I missing?
As a side note I have come across some information that suggests changing the valuation algorithm to account for the transposition table and have done so (hopefully correctly).
",['monte-carlo-tree-search'],"I have had a chat with ChatGPT which helped me wrap my head around it:An important factor here is that my simulation (also called a rollout) consists of random play. Because of this I need ot visit this state and pplay randomly for many times in order to be able to somewhat accurately estimate the value of the position.The aim of adding a transposition table is to save computation of states that have already been evaluated before. But you can store multiple evaluations before skipping the simulation and reusing the value once your confidence in it is high enough. It depends on the game and the size of the search space and most importantly the way you achieve the game value (random play simulation vs for example a neural network as alpha zero does it) how large that number needs to be.Another important aspect I learned is that you need to persist the table and use it for later games. If you don't it will not be effective, because you only save the states in the past which you likely will not encounter (there are some exceptions like both players putting a piece back sequentially). So essentially it becomes a dataset."

How to get optimal Scaling with raw PyTorch+DDP?,"

How to approach a toy classification problem using a neural network?,"
The toy problem: 
50 unique numbers are randomly selected from number 0 to 99.

If number 1 appears in the selection but number 2 doesn't, the selection is labelled as ""1"". 
If number 2 appears in the selection but number 1 doesn't, the selection is labelled as ""2"". 
If both number 1 and number 2 appear in the selection, the selection is labelled as ""3"". 
Lastly, if neither 1 nor 2 appears in the selection, the selection is labelled as ""0"".
Let's say we want to use a fully connected neural network to classify the selections. The number of input nodes would be 50, which is the number of items in each selection. The number of output nodes will be 4, which will be number of labels/classes. The loss function is cross entry loss which is commonly used in classification problems. The activation function for the hidden layers is ReLU(or leaky ReLU). The question is how do we decide on the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each layer? Also let's say we use stochastic gradient descent(SGD) as optimizer, how do we choose the learning rate? Also the training batch size?
I have tried some arbitrary values for those hyper parameters. In some cases the loss doesn't decrease. In some cases the loss decrease to almost 0 for the training data set, but the prediction accuracy for the validation dataset is 25%, which is as good as random guess.Is there any guidelines/heuristics on how to choose those hyperparameters?

Can I use this method to improve the VAE model?,"
My VAE model is not learning well.
The model's learning history shows that the reconstruction loss is as large as approximately 8000 or more, and the KL-Divergence loss is diverging, starting with an initial value of approximately 13.
The source code of my model was modified from the source code published on the vae tutorial on the keras learning site
enter link description here
Receives a one-dimensional image of image 128x128 as input and outputs a one-dimensional image of 128x128.
As a result of considering the cause of the divergence of KL loss while the reconstruction loss decreases in the overall loss of my model,
I thought that because the reconstruction loss is too large for the KL loss, the KL loss accounts for a very small portion of the total loss.
Therefore, I came up with the following method.
When the model starts learning for the first time, the reconstruction loss for the first batch is r_max
The final goal of the model is to bring the reconstruction loss closer to zero
Leave r_min at zero.
KL loss also in the same way as above
Obtain values for k_max, k_min.
Then take the values of r_min, r_max and k_min, k_max and replace each loss with a value from 0 to 1.
With this method, the reconstruction loss and KL loss values are within a similar range
I think the model's learning will go well.
I've only thought about it theoretically, but I haven't done an experiment yet.

What metrics are there to measure the similarity of two disjoint sets of points?,"
I'm training an AI model to predict where to place train stations along a train track.
Specifically, I want to feed my model some information about the train track. The model generates a series of points A, B, C, ... that correspond to stations that I should place on the train track.
For instance, some prediction P could look like:
=====A========================B===============================C==========

I also have a ground truth T for my training examples. For instance, that could look like:
=========A====================B=========C=============================D==

Now, what I want is a metric to measure my model.
I've been thinking about possible solutions, but none of the usual candidates seem to fit this problem. Some ideas I've considered are:
Creating a custom F1 score
To do so, get the distance of each point in P with respect to the closest point in T (precision). Likewise, get the distance of each point in T with respect to the closest one in P (recall). Duplicates are allowed (for instance, T(B) and T(C) would both be matched against P(B)).
This suffers from a small problem, however. Consider an alternative P:
=====A====================B=C=D=E=F===========================G==========

In this case, precision and recall would remain more or less the same. However, I would like the score to reflect the fact that many more points than expected have been placed along the track.
Metrics for Time Series
During my research of metrics I've searched on the time series domain just in case there was something similar to this problem but I've found nothing that closely resembles this scenario.
Things that the score should reflect

T has more points than G.
G has more points than T.
The distance between predicted points and ground truth ones and vice versa.

I don't want to reinvent the wheel, and this seems like a (possibly) common scenario.

","['chat-bots', 'large-language-models']","An effort to distinguish content from good content.One of the major complaints about ChatGPT (certainly you'll see this all over Stack Exchange sites) is that it tends to deliver low quality answers.

As such, I think you would very rarely see ChatGPT generated content being very popular or upvoted (even if it wasn't outright banned).I think that's the sort of thing that a training session should try to take into account: not ""what is the source of this"" but ""is the source popular, well liked, or notable"".If you were training ChatGPT from Stack Exchange input, then an obvious first step would be to have it skip anything with low numbers of views or low number of upvotes. SE is already telling you which questions and answers are low quality, so avoiding those is a good idea, and this would also, I believe, incidentally keep a chatbot from ingesting other chatbot output (because the typical rambling, vaguely off-topic chatbot outputs would rarely make it into the ""high quality"" category).Similarly, you don't know if a website is created by a chatbot, but if you can gauge its notability or appeal, you can at least try to make a judgement about if it's worth using as a training source. Not notable? Not by a known author? Low page view count? Unknown website? Skip it.Basically, just don't train a chatbot by having it willy-nilly go through the entire internet A-Z. The inputs need some curation. The more you can steer it away from low quality inputs, the better its training will be and, incidentally, the more likely it is to avoid inputting previous rounds of low quality chatbot output."
Difference between sequence length and hidden size in LSTM,"
It does not come clear to me how the seq_length is not the exact same as the hidden_size in LSTMs.
For example, in the next image, the seq_length is T since there are $x_{1}, x_{2}, ..., x_{T}$ time steps and there are is one LSTM cell (green LSTM blocks) per input $x_{i}$. So in this image seq_length == hidden_size

In addition, every LSTM cell requires 3 inputs:

$x_{t}$ the input value at time t.
$h_{t-1}$ the hidden state value from the previous time step.
$c_{t-1}$ the cell state value from the previous time step.

This can be seen in the following image:

How can the hidden_size be lower or higher than the seq_length? In any of both cases the LSTM cells would not have the $x_{i}$ input which is required.

Using MSE or RMSE instead of CrossEntropy in Question Answering NLP problems. What are the problems if we used?,"
When you predict Start Index, end Index in Question Answering NLP task (SQUAD Data), you use CrossEntropy as a loss function. Won't it be same if you used MSE or RMSE for the same because at the end of the model, all we're trying to find is an absolute number from the given max_length (suppose 300). We could Regress this number?
2 problems I can think of are:

MSE or RMSE will give unbounded values in the starting (for example 4321) even though we have a max length of 300 but I think it'll settle down eventually with training.
If the original Index was 5 logit could predict 4 which is Very okay for MSE as it's just 1.0 points away (worse could 300) but according to CrossEntropy, it's as bad as predicting 300.

I just want to know what other problems can be there if we used and when one should be used in place of other?
For example in Binary Image Segmentation, both can be used but BinaryCrossEntropy would give better results as the boundary is strict 0-1 etc.
Apart from the very obvious, If you look at

MSE is Cross Entropy at heart
Comparing Sigmoid-MSE With Softmax Cross-Entropy for Image Classification
Can we use cross entropy to solve the regression problem?

You'll get a sense that you can use them but there is a caveat, for example in the first link, it is beautifully explained that:

For example, there is an application of MSE loss in a task named Super Resolution in which (as the name suggests) we try to increase the resolution of a small image as best as possible to get a visually appealing image. If we use MSE loss alone, the final image will be really blurry and not appealing. Knowing that MSE is a kind of Cross Entropy where we assume that our target distribution is Gaussian, we can easily find out the reason why our model produces these blurry images: because it assumes that pixel data is normally distributed and always picks the values which have the most probability; i.e. the values from the middle of the bell-curve. So, it rarely uses the values which make the image sharp and appealing because they are far from the middle of the bell-curve and have really low probabilities. Our model becomes conservative in a sense that when it doubts what value it should pick, it picks the most probable ones which make the image blurry!

Term for algorithms that are not trained,"
Before the advent of neural architectures, many AI domains (e.g. speech recognition and computer vision) used algorithms that consisted of a series of hand-crafted transformations for feature extraction.

In speech recognition everything to do with spectrograms or cepstra is done based on the mathematical theory of (discrete) Fourier transforms.
In computer vision, edge detectors like Sobel/Canny or feature descriptors like SIFT are all convolution-based.

You can implement all of these with everyday procedural programs. All the intelligence of these methods is embedded within the steps of the program, and not in its parameters.
One thing I have been wondering about is what you would call such algorithms that work ""out of the box"". My inclination is to call them deterministic, but this is clearly wrong considering most neural networks (not including e.g. VAEs) are deterministic functions of their input too.
Perhaps some might call them dumb, but that's also not right, because these algorithms are very sophisticated and purposefully made. They're not naive like naive Bayes is naive. It's not because they aren't trained that they aren't artificially intelligent.
Traditional or classical is too vague, because neural nets have existed for more than half a century and could be considered that too. The same goes for algorithmic and procedural.
Is there standard terminology to delimit the set of such artificially-intelligent-but-not-data-driven algorithms?

Reducing the learning has increased the maximum reward value while training. However, both learning rates still result in high fluctuation in the total reward. It seems like the reward is very sensitive to the actions performed by the DDQN agent. The fluctuation in reward is much bigger than the start of the training.
This is counter-intuitive to me since the exploration rate decreases as the step number increases. Lower exploration should result in a lower variance in the reward value. Even though the average reward does flatten out, in both cases the reward variance is much higher at the end than at the beginning of the training.
The Four values out of the five values of state is not dependent on the previous action made by the agent. So it makes the convergence of the algorithm very hard. I have tried tuning hyper parameters, but could not achieve better than the above two cases.

Creating or using a corpus for a chatbot interaction modelling for an existing intelligent tutor system,"
I'm currently researching and building a chatbot to link to an existing intelligent tutoring system for the domain of the topic of relational databases. The current intelligent tutoring system is rudimentary (forms with checkboxes and the sort, a quiz type) and anything could serve the purpose of modeling the dialogue that would be better than just reading a textbook or having a passive attitude in the classroom. The main problem is that I don't have any corpora to utilize, besides the hardcoded questions, and I don't have any time at all to create a better corpus from scratch.
My thesis adviser gave me the starting point for a dialogue model: the chatbot would ask a question and the student would try to answer. Depending on the feedback, the student could ask ""how"", ""why"", or ""explain"".
There is research showing that using theoretical frameworks to guide the learning goals of a chatbot could help students learn more effectively by moving from passive to active learning. It is really necessary to understand learning objectives before starting to develop. A theoretical framework can guide the dialogue modeling.
This happens, for instance, with CodingTutor which is an agent to help students learn how to program. It uses the revised Bloom taxonomy to combine different types of knowledge to help the person learn. This is still complex because there are many types of questions, answers, and other types of interaction like solving a programming exercise. The CodingTutor approach could be an option if I didn't lack time.
On the other hand, other ITS with a chatbot module was implemented by using the user's own questions to a previous iteration of the ITS chatbot and Google queries. The learning goal was only memory retention. The students asked ""Why"", ""Advantages/Disadvantages"", ""Application of"", ""How"" and ""Who"". This is a more reasonable approach than CodingTutor but with a caveat: I have no corpus.
There are other ITSs, like AutoTutor, that use expectation-and-misconception tutoring (EMT). Still, the complexity is greater and I would have to hardcode every single misconception to a single expectation.
My question is if there are some corpora that I could use for the simple learning objective of memory retention using ""why"", ""how"", and ""explain"" for the topic of relational databases.

EDIT: given that it's thesis research, according to my adviser, the topic of relational databases of the intelligent tutor isn't fundamental, but it has to be useful for instance K-12 Geography. The chatbot is a complementary module to an intelligent tutor, and the intelligent tutor is still bare bones that any corpus - with some learning objectives in mind - would suffice. Also, the end result of that said intelligent tutor far into the future would be to be cross-domain (not open-domain), for instance, to be able to be adapted for different domains in a standalone fashion (different training sets, different corpora, the works).
However, given that there isn't any corpus for that intelligent tutor, ANY corpus would be better. So, a corpus for relational databases Q&A created with ChatGPT would be enough (with all the inherited problems doing so, like bias, incorrect answers, etc.). Now the ""how to"" is more important than the actual accuracy. In other words, the corpus had to be accurate enough.

Embedding an item-item similarity matrix within an implicit feedback recommender using ALS,"
it feels like there is an obvious answer to this but I am struggling to fully get my head around this.
BACKGROUND:
I am trying to build a recommender based on implicit feedback using the implicit library in Python. This part is generally fine. My input is a m x n matrix where m is the number of users and n the number of items. The values represent the interactions and also embed a measure of confidence in said interaction.
PROBLEM:
In order to improve the performance of the recommender, I would like to somehow integrate an item-item similarity matrix. For example, knowing a movie's director, genre, length, etc. I would like to establish the similarities among the various movie pairs (i.e. a n x n matrix of similarity scores) and feed them into the ALS model in order to make better predictions given that some items are more similar than others.
Any help is greatly appreciated.

We have been working on a deep learning problem for a few iterations now.  We've been tweaking the preprocessing as we go.  We've also been training models as we go.
The people using the models for inference need to do the same preprocessing on their data as we used on our training data.
Is there any standard way of 'versioning' the preprocessing code so that it can be linked to the models that used that version?  I could use GitHub versions or tags, and maybe that's the best way.  Or is there some other technique that is widely used?
",['data-preprocessing'],"Using GitHub versions and tags is certainly one way to go. However, there are more sophisticated techniques and tools you might want to consider:Data Version Control (DVC): DVC is a popular open-source tool for versioning data and preprocessing code, specifically designed for machine learning projects. It provides a Git-like interface to manage both data and code, allowing you to link specific versions of your data and preprocessing pipeline with corresponding model versions. You can learn more about DVC at https://dvc.org/.MLflow: MLflow is an open-source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It includes tools for tracking experiments, packaging code into reproducible runs, and sharing and deploying models. With MLflow, you can track different versions of your preprocessing code, data, and models, and switch between them when needed. You can learn more about MLflow at https://mlflow.org/.Docker: Another way to ensure consistency in your preprocessing is by using Docker containers. You can create a Docker image with the required dependencies and preprocessing code, and then use this image for both training and inference. This ensures that the same code and environment are used at each stage. You can then version the Docker images using tags, and store them in a container registry such as Docker Hub or Google Container Registry. You can learn more about Docker at https://www.docker.com/."

Should Cart Pole be immune to Reward Shifting?,"
I’ve been toying around with cart pole swingup, and have been flummoxed by a problem related to reward shifts. Traditionally, cart pole gives you positive reward if you’re stable and zero reward if you’re out of the acceptable set.
In my version of cart pole swingup, when I have 0 terminal reward and strictly positive normal reward, the system learns to balance.
if is_terminal(s)
  return 0
end

return 100 - x^2 - signed_dist(theta, 0)^2

However, if I shift this reward by 100, it flounders and fails.
if is_terminal(s)
  return -100
end

return - x^2 - signed_dist(theta, 0)^2

My understanding of the theory is that shifting the reward shouldn’t affect anything. Any idea what I am missing? Thank you!
",['actor-critic-methods'],"I convinced myself that the problem has to do with the fact that rollouts terminate when a terminal state is reached. In principle, a reward shift should not affect the optimal policy. However, it does matter in this case because we do not see the terminal rewards (except the first one). As such, all subsequent states effectively have 0 reward. If 0 reward is bigger than your typical reward, it can entice the actor to seek out a terminal state.Note that due to discounting, 1 state’s worth of terminal reward is being compared to gamma / (1 - gamma) * ave_reward, which means if the first is -100 and gamma is 0.99 for cart-pole, ave_reward has to be above -1.0101 to be more enticing. In my case that wasn’t true.Potential mitigations include:"

Why is soft actor critic an off policy scheme?,"
I am struggling to understand what makes a scheme on-policy or off-policy. From what I have read, we can say that deep Q-learning is off-policy because we use a different policy like $\epsilon$-greedy technique for exploration while training our DNN, so this makes the behavior policy ($\epsilon$-greedy) and the target policy (from DNN) to be different.
However, in the case of soft actor-critic (SAC) we use the same policy DNN to generate the data stored in the memory buffer. Later we use this data to update the policy DNN. There is only one DNN that is being used for generating the data for exploration, while this data is used for updating the policy network (same DNN). When the DNN is the same, how can we say that the behavior policy and target policy are different?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'actor-critic-methods', 'soft-actor-critic']","SAC is an off-policy method because it learns from a replay buffer, which contains experiences collected by the agent over time from potentially different versions of the policy. This means the agent can learn from past experiences generated by older versions of the policy, which might not be the same as the current policy."
"Seq2seq with RNNs, how is the training loop performed?","
How do we train a seq2seq rnn training?
We input a sentence that needs to be translated. We encode it sequentially. Then the first decoder outputs the first word with probabilities. We do a gradient descent by comparing them with the actual word expected. Then we input to the second decoder the hidden state and it outputs the second word with probabilities. We do another gradient descent. But what if the first hidden state was wrong because it failed to output the right word? Then this second gradient descent is meaningless?
","['recurrent-neural-networks', 'backpropagation', 'seq2seq']","In seq2seq RNN training, we usually use a technique called ""teacher forcing."" With teacher forcing, the actual (ground truth) output word at each timestep is fed as input to the decoder in the next timestep, rather than using the model's previous prediction. This approach helps the model learn faster because it doesn't rely on previous potentially incorrect predictions, which might indeed lead to a cascading effect of errors.However, during inference (when actually translating sentences), the model doesn't have access to ground truth outputs. So, it uses its own predictions as input for the next timestep. This can lead to some discrepancies between training and inference, known as ""exposure bias."" To mitigate this, a technique called ""scheduled sampling"" is sometimes used, which involves gradually transitioning from teacher forcing to using the model's own predictions during training."
Repainting a picture in the style of some painter (or of another picture),"
It sounds like a straight-forward task for DALL-E (and GPT?) to present a painting and ask  to repaint it ""in the style of Leonardo da Vinci"".

So, a natural consideration is: when prompt has become a paradigm for aligning LLM with human needs, how can we eliminate the impact of prompt and recover LLM?
But perhaps a more economical strategy would be to open a new session window and give the LLM a prompt about the open-domain QA.

OpenAI confirm this approach in their general GPT documentation.Inherently, the core of ChatGPT - the GPT large language model - is not a chatbot.

How does transformer models like GPT generate valid meaningful response for meaningless garbage input?,"
My understanding of a transformer model is that it uses the given input to calculate internal query of relate-ness of word meanings, and generate a meaningful response based on its meaning. But if your given sentence has no meaning, then won't the model fail to capture any meaningful input so that the output will also be meaningless? How does the ChatGPT generate meaningful response asking me what I meant when the input is uncoordinated and meaningless? Is that a feature, or did they train on that kind of input specifically?
eg. Input ""Jumps the dog lazy fox over quick brown the.""
For the output, ChatGPT asks for clarification.
Normally for a self-attention based model, there won't be any relation between input word for this example, so shouldn't the output also be garbage like?

Help on Object-Detection Task - Detection of Cracks on Walls (Pre-Trained Models etc.),"

Lately, we have been trying to implement a Neural Network Model for our Project and, so far, we have had some progress worth of respect.
Our Project is about detecting cracks in images of parts of walls (in a certain dataset, of course). As it is obvious, it is an object-detection task, for which we have to ""draw"" a bounding box for the images of a testing dataset with as much overlap with a ground-truth bounding box as possible, one for each image.
The progress we have made refers to managing to build a certain implementation with a YOLO architecture (in particular YOLOv5s). Now, except educating ourselves more on solutions and architectures, as much as we are able to, we are at the point of our work at which we are trying to improve the progress we have already had. Among the ideas we discussed is the following one: starting the training of our Network with  a pre-trained model (with pre-trained weights). Now, we are trying to find such models, among other ideas we work on.

Should softmax be in the model or in the loss function?,"
Suppose I have an image segmentation model with an output of [ 128, 128, 2 ], segmenting an input image into 2 parts.
Commonly, loss functions have the sigmoid or softmax needed to produce a probability distribution in the loss function itself, for example:
tf.nn.sigmoid_cross_entropy_with_logits
tf.nn.softmax_cross_entropy_with_logits

Alternatively, one could include the softmax or sigmoid call in the last layer fo a model:
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # ...
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(2, kernel_size=1, padding=""same"", activation=""softmax"")
])

My question is this: Why could you keep the softmax / sigmoid in the loss function instead of in the last layer of the model?
Wouldn't putting it in the last layer of the model ensure that the output of the model is constrained, enabling the model to more effectively learn the boundaries of the given input as smaller gradients would be needed for the model to change its mind on a given pixel?

Reverse Process in Diffusion Model Doesn't Return Original Image,"
I am attempting to program a Denoising Diffusion Model based on the one introduced in the article by Ho et al. (2020). However, I have run into issues while testing the reverse diffusion process.
Walking through my PyTorch code, I first load an image x, which I normalize, and generate a fixed noise tensor e ($\epsilon$) the same size as x. I also define a noise schedule with 10 steps, where a and d correspond to $\alpha$ and $\overline\alpha$ in the paper. The calls to unsqueeze and view are only to make the dimensions compatible for the computations that follow.
x = read_image(""data/in/dog.jpg"").unsqueeze(0) / 255 * 2 - 1
e = torch.randn(x.shape)
a = torch.linspace(0.9, 0.5, 9).view(-1, 1, 1, 1, 1)
d = a.cumprod(0)

Then, I gradually apply noise to the original image, concatenating each new sample along the first dimension. This process follows the recommended formula $x_t = \sqrt{\overline\alpha_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \overline\alpha_t} \epsilon$.
for t in range(9):
    x = torch.cat((x, d[t].sqrt() * x[0] + (1 - d[t]).sqrt() * e))

This results in a gradual noising process, as expected.

Next, I attempt to remove the noise using the formula $x_{t-1} = x_t - \frac{\sqrt{1 - \alpha_t}}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} \epsilon$, derived from $x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \epsilon$.
for t in range(8, -1, -1):
    x = torch.cat((x, (x[-1:] - (1 - a[t]).sqrt() * e) / a[t].sqrt()))

This, however, has a strange result. It seems that the image is being denoised up to a certain point, but starts getting noisier thereafter.

I believe that this is due to $\epsilon$ in the formula $x_t = \sqrt{\overline\alpha_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1 - \overline\alpha_t} \epsilon$ not being the same as in $x_t = \sqrt{\alpha_t} x_{t-1} + \sqrt{1 - \alpha_t} \epsilon$. However, it seems to make sense that the denoising process would deterministically lead to the original image when the noise $\epsilon$ applied at each time step is known. Why is this not the case?
EDIT: After a lot of fiddling around, I have managed to use the formula $x_{t-1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} x_t + \frac{1 - \overline\alpha_t - \sqrt{(1 - \overline\alpha_t)(\alpha_t - \overline\alpha_t)}}{\sqrt{1 - \overline\alpha_t}\sqrt{\alpha_t}}\epsilon$ to correctly predict the reverse diffusion process. This, however, raises more questions than answers. I notice that the formula resembles that of the mean of the ground truth decoder $q(x_{t-1}\vert x_t, x_0)$, $\mu_q(x_t, x_0)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_t}} x_t + \frac{1 - \alpha_t}{\sqrt{1 - \overline\alpha_t}\sqrt{\alpha_t}}\epsilon$, but is not equal to it. What is going on here?

"Smaller, competitive LLMs that are not autoregressive transformers?","
Large language models like GPT have been really successful lately. One downside is that they require a huge amount of resources to train, and still a lot of resources for inference, such that most models can't run inference on consumer hardware. Another problem is that they do not have an explicit world model, so that you can not be 100% sure if a response is factual or hallucinated.
Along the old neat-scruffy axis, I wonder if there are alternative architectures that are a bit more in the scruffy direction. For example, I could imagine that you use deep learning only for ""language understanding"", but for ""world knowledge"" you would have a fact database like a triplestore. The language model of such a system would be much smaller, only needing to reproduce basic grammar, and the facts would be explicit instead of implicit.
So are there any - potentially competitive - NLP models that are not of the autoregressive transformer type, scruffier, smaller, and yet operating in a similar space to GPT-3, LLaMA and co.?

In the paper Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space, the authors say that ""avoiding normalized models completely by using models that are not normalized during training"" is a practical solution for reducing the complexity that comes from ""H × V"" for an NNLM with a projection layer, a hidden layer and an output layer where H is the hidden layer size and V is the vocabulary size.
I can't quite understand why it is the case and I'd love some hints because for me normalization won't change the dimensions (and I think it helps with convergence) so it shouldn't reduce complexity.

How do I transform this in order to obtain a dataset similar enough to COCO that I could try to run predictions using the prebuilt models on it?

Best fitness function for car driving around a procedural race track?,"
I am using the NEAT algorithm to power a car around a procedural race track. Each generation, a new track is created to avoid the car overfitting the environment.
The aim is for the car to drive around the track as fast as possible. The issue is a fitness function that can reflect progress and enable comparison over multiple generations.
E.g Using the average speed or time to complete lap as the car fitness function
For some generations, this value will be high as the track is easy to navigate (e.g straight paths), however there may be instances where tracks are generated with multiple turns. This will require the car to slow down and therefore have a smaller fitness score. It becomes hard to determine if a car is doing well by its own merit or if it is being hampered/assisted by hard/easy tracks.

The above is an exaggerated example of what the fitness would looks like. There would be no consistency as the peaks would be easy tracks and the low fitness scores are challenging tracks.
So my question is, what is a good fitness function which can measure the performance of each generation without it being influenced by the layout of the track?

On the other hand, there were rumors that training of GPT-3 was done with errors, but re-train was impossible due to the costs.
","['open-ai', 'gpt', 'gpt-3', 'gpt-4']","GPT-4 is a transformer like GPT-3 and any other GPT. The training is certainly new, because it has a different size, you just can not transfer GPT-3 weights into an GPT-4 to continue training.The details of the implementation are currently not known, the published report about it is not a scientific paper about how GPT-4 works, it basically states ""we do not say how it works"", see below.The size of various components certainly differ,
at least the number of weights in one part, but it could also be larger everywhere. The prompt length (context size) and the maximal output size increased a lot, from 4000 tokens to 8000 or even 32000 tokens.
I would expect there are some other minor differences.Other major differences can be the amount of training data,
and the compute used for training.
My personal speculation is that GPT-4 used a lot more compute for training, with possibly a similar amount of training data as GPT-3.From the ""GPT-4 Technical Report"", section 2:Given both the competitive landscape and the safety implications of

Preventing Overfitting While Cross Validating Time Series Models,"
I have some time series data (e.g. daily rainfall for 10 years) and I am interested in fitting a time series model to this data and record the error.
I want to use the ""rolling window cross validation"" (e.g. https://robjhyndman.com/files/cv1-1.png) approach to measure error.

Fit a model to the first 60 data points, predict the next 5 and record the error
Next, fit a model model to the first 65 points, predict the next 5 and record the error
etc.

I want to use the auto.arima() function (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/forecast/versions/8.3/topics/auto.arima) in R : function chooses the optimal arima model at each segment.
However, I am confused on whether using the auto.arima() approach is logically correct, because the arima model fit on the fitst 60 points might be potentially different (e.g. different estimates of the p,q,d coefficients) than the model predicted on the first 65 points - thus, I am worried that the average quality and reliability of a single model is not being recorded, but rather - the quality and reliability of many individual models: thus, there is risk for overfitting and obtaining a lower error than in reality (i.e. false confidence in your model).
However, I think that the following argument can be made :

In real life, we have the option to refit models when we believe that the phenomena we are modelling is changing as we collect more information.
Thus, this cross validation process is measuring the average ""generic error of an auto.arima model"" over a variety of conditions.
As a result, all error calculations obtained from this cross validation approach reflect the general ability of the  auto.arima procedure to adapt and generalize to new data, and the earlier concerns on overfitting (sourcing specifically from this rolling cross validation) might be partly mitigated.

Can someone please comment on this?
Thanks!

"What exactly is meant as losing the ""competitive moat"" when sharing AI models?","
I just read this seemingly interesting and important insight from Eliezer Yudkowsky on Twitter, which I copy here for reference:

I don't think people realize what a big deal it is that Stanford retrained a LLaMA model, into an instruction-following form, by cheaply fine-tuning it on inputs and outputs from text-davinci-003.
It means:  If you allow any sufficiently wide-ranging access to your AI model, even by paid API, you're giving away your business crown jewels to competitors that can then nearly-clone your model without all the hard work you did to build up your own fine-tuning dataset.  If you successfully enforce a restriction against commercializing an imitation trained on your I/O - a legal prospect that's never been tested, at this point - that means the competing checkpoints go up on bittorrent.
I'm not sure I can convey how much this is a brand new idiom of AI as a technology.  Let's put it this way:
If you put a lot of work into tweaking the mask of the shoggoth, but then expose your masked shoggoth's API - or possibly just let anyone build up a big-enough database of Qs and As from your shoggoth - then anybody who's brute-forced a core unmasked shoggoth can gesture to your shoggoth and say to their shoggoth ""look like that one"", and poof you no longer have a competitive moat.
It's like the thing where if you let an unscrupulous potential competitor get a glimpse of your factory floor, they'll suddenly start producing a similar good - except that they just need a glimpse of the inputs and outputs of your factory.  Because the kind of good you're producing is a kind of pseudointelligent gloop that gets sculpted; and it costs money and a simple process to produce the gloop, and separately more money and a complicated process to sculpt the gloop; but the raw gloop has enough pseudointelligence that it can stare at other gloop and imitate it.
In other words:  The AI companies that make profits will be ones that either have a competitive moat not based on the capabilities of their model, OR those which don't expose the underlying inputs and outputs of their model to customers, OR can successfully sue any competitor that engages in shoggoth mask cloning.

There is more notes in his thread comments.
I don't quite fully understand what he is saying, or the major implications he is talking about. Can you explain in simpler terms or more basic concepts (or metaphors even) what they are saying?

If you allow any sufficiently wide-ranging access to your AI model, even by paid API, you're giving away your business crown jewels to competitors that can then nearly-clone your model without all the hard work you did to build up your own fine-tuning dataset.

So giving API access to your AI model (like ChatGPT is doing? or like LLaMA is doing with its open source model?) is giving away your competitive advantage, I get that. But why/how is it giving away your competitive advantage? How can they clone the model just by using the interface?

Are CNNs exactly translation invariant with global max/average pooling layers?,"
CNNs are naturally translation equivariant, meaning that if we translate the input, then the feature maps are translated the equally.
With the use of max/avg pooling layers, this translation equivariance leads to approximate translation invariance, in the sense that it gives translation invariance for small translations, but for longer translation, the max/avg values could differ due to the limitations by the size of the pooling and the module of the translation.
However, if I use the biggest size possible for the pooling, i.e. global max/avg pooling, then the CNN will be translation invariant in an exact way, for every translation of the input, no matter the strength (module) of the translation.
Is this intuition correct? I can visualize this in my head, but I can't really visualize if this effect would hold for deep networks (i.e. after many conv->global pool layers are stacked).
","['convolutional-neural-networks', 'computer-vision']","Your intuition is correct, when you apply many local feature detectors (convolutions) and throw the results into one big pot (any global pooling), only the amount of detected features matters, not their location in the image, i.e. you achieved translation invariance.
Doing this for deep ConvNets like you describe does not make a lot of sense to me, because applying the global pooling once will squash your feature map into a single feature vector. When you look at the shape before and after the global pooling operation, this would look as follows:[batch, height, width, channels] --global-pool--> [batch, channels]Therefore your notion of space disappears completely which would prevent you from applying any subsequent spatial convolutions."

Then the on-line rollout algorithm selects the control with minimal Q-factor which is a specific heuristic search algorithm using the base heuristic (policy) to further simulate the behavior of the control system over a finite time horizon under the (suboptimal) rollout policy."

Is understanding understandable?,"
While wandering about the ability of Large Language Models to understand, and the Chinese room argument (related question Is the ""Chinese room"" an explanation of how ChatGPT works?) I got into a mess with the very idea of understanding. Understanding something external to understanding looks like possible: we can somehow understand an ant by observing it, its shape, its behaviour... We study an object with a different object with no overlap.
Now, how about attempting to understand everything? In particular, what happens when one wants to understand understanding?
A reasonable object for understanding are understandable things. In particular, if understanding is understandable, a greedy agent would try to understand understanding. Now, if understanding is always understandable, understanding understanding is also understandable, so now the agent would be after understanding understanding understanding. Since for any order of understanding one can define a higher order understanding, there is no possible end to understanding, even with the single object of study $understanding$.
I am not sure whether we should compare this infinite chain of embedded $understanding^k$ to the natural numbers, where there is a final support (zero) for anything to be understood; or to the integers, where there is no first integer number to the left and thus no possible end to fully understanding understanding.

Is complete understanding impossible?

","['philosophy', 'chinese-room-argument']","The first issue is defining understanding. I don't want to go too deep here, but serious readers should likely go over some commonly accepted definitions and over the field of Epistemology. To make my point simple I will metaphorically define understanding as (theoretical) ability to draw on a piece of paper the inner workings on the object to be understood. Imagine a long, but finite, list of all the configurations of the object, all the behaviours in a given environment, etc.According to this definition, is understanding an ant possible? Kind of. If we assume that the list is small, then yes. I suspect that, according to the specific definition of the list, the list may be so long that even an ant cannot be completely understood. The limitation is coming from the finite amount of resources available in our universe.This applies similarly to understanding, for instance understanding a system of human+ant in which a human is understanding an ant.
It's clear that this requires orders of magnitudes more ""paper"" than just understanding an ant.Going up the hierarchy, while in principle nothing is stopping you from understanding everything, you simply run out of paper to write on. So it's not possible to understand everything.If the universe is infinite (and so the resources) it gets more complicated. There can be a regime in which infinity is giving you enough resources to describe everything, if the infinity is ""countable"" in a sense, with your countable amount of paper sheets.
Or the infinity may be ""uncountable"", and complexity is growing faster than you are able to write it down on paper.Perhaps the ultimate strategy to understand everything (weird statement incoming) may be to become the whole universe and understand yourself (which of course I will leave as an exercise to the reader)."

How vision models based on CNNs learn the relative positions of each pixel in the image?,"
A CNN model is based on a series of filters applied to an image. However, these filters can only ""see"" a small portion of the image and they have no information of the relative position of the pixels that they are analyzing with respect to the image coordinates. Likewise, deeper in the network, they have no information of the the position of the field of view that they are analyzing with respect to the coordinate-system of the image. In other words, if trained correctly, these modes are translation-invariant and they do not ""know"" the region of the image to which some features belong (ie, they have no information if some extracted features belong to the lower, upper, right or left part of the image).
I was wondering how a model like, for example, YOLO can infer the relative coordinates of the objects that it is detecting, without having this information. I understand that the image is divided in in a grid of cells and that gives some notion of region (ie, part of the image that is being analyzed). However, we still have to guess the width, height and relative x,y position with respect to the cell. Why don't we overlap the input image (or extracted features) with some kind of positional encoding (the x,y coordinates for example), so that the model has information of the region of the image to which some features belong?
This question also applies to other CNN models like, for example, U-Net architectures. I think that it may be useful to have some information of the position of the pixels/feature map with respect to the image's coordinates in some problems. For example, to segment the road in self-driving problems, it will be very useful to ""know"" if the region of the image that is being analyzed is in the bottom part of the image as, most-likely, the road will be found there.
How does these models infer this information? And, why is not common to add this ""positional encoding"" in deep learning projects applied to images?

Is the input embedding split along the embedding dimension so that every head of the multi-head-attention module just gets a part of the input data?,"
So I found two contradictory explanations of the MHA (multi-head-self-attention-module):
In the first approach, the input embedding (= the input matrix) is split along the embedding dimension and all heads are given a subset of the dimensions/features of each word.
Some websites supporting this theory:
https://medium.com/@smitasasindran/12-attention-mechanisms-multihead-attention-958041a35553
-> Quote: ""The input has been split into multiple heads, and we are running the attention model separately on each of these heads.""
https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-code-the-transformer-in-pytorch-24db27c8f9ec#3fa3 -> Quote: ""In multi-head attention we split the embedding vector into N heads, so they will then have the dimensions batch_size * N * seq_len * (d_model / N).""


The second approach assumes that all heads receive the entire input data, but different weight matrices are used for each head depending on the number of heads.
This theory is well explained on https://hungsblog.de/en/technology/learnings/visual-explanation-of-multi-head-attention/
-> Quote: ""Each head is responsible to fully calculate the attention for the whole embedding, not just for a subset of it and creates h attention matrices""
I tend to the second explanation, but have not been able to find a satisfactory and contradiction-free answer so far.

I'm confused on what the output should look like and represent in terms of Q values. Based on having 4 neurons I think we should get 4 outputs and the one with the max probability would be the associated action to be taken. I'm confused on how to get information for the Q values, I think that each observation space should have 4 associated Q values for each action (so 16 x 4). Based on my limited knowledge and going over the documentation for BindsNet I'm unable to figure out why my algorithm doesn't seem to be learning.
I've confirmed that pipeline.network.learning is True and that the code is stepping through a couple of functions that based on their names seem to be used for training or the forward step. However, the parameters or values in the layers of the network don't seem to be changing.
I'm also confused on why this gymnasium has specified rewards for this game as either reward 1 or 0. How would we get an accumulated reward for an episode? Shouldn't the accumulated reward be affected if the agent reached the goal in 5 steps vs. 10 steps?
Any help would be really appreciated.

Why can't traditional neural networks learn to perform the same tasks that attention layers do?,"
If your task is to predict $t_{n+1}$ given tokens $(t_1,...,t_n)$, you could do two things:

Straight NN - feed $t=(t_1,...,t_n)$ into a neural network as an n-dimensional input and train it on predicting $t_{n+1}$ (with all the embedding / layernorm / skip connection stuff that transformer models have)
Attention - take $t_n$ plus information from $t_1,...,t_{n-1}$ relevant to $t_n$ computed in the attention layer (plus positional encoding) and feed that into a neural network to predict $t_{n+1}$

In one case you're putting everything into the NN, equally weighted. In another, you're taking certain information from each token weighted by relevance to $t_n$.
My question is: why can't the straight NN learn this? What was wrong with the straight NN model so that we needed into introduce attention? If it was helpful to upweight certain things by a relevance metric, why wouldn't the NN learn that?
My only thought so far is long-range dependency: that a NN might forget information far back in the sequence (as in general it will be less useful). For example, 'he walked into the kitchen, took the chocolate from the drawer, opened wide and put it into' – to predict the next word you really need to look all the way back to the start of the sentence.
Thanks for your help!

Rewards
Reward = $\frac{Score}{Work}$
I have various states in the dataset which are ordered chronologically and each state contains a reward from (0 -> inf)
rewards come in 2 types a very small reward then very sparsely a high reward is given.
To calculate the reward from a state is an expensive operation.
The model can discard states to increase the reward density
reward per work.
For example lets consider 2 cases\

model 0: do nothing
model 1: optimal

model 1: reward = $\frac{10+0+0}{1+0.1+0.1}$ = 8.33


To avoid the model discarding most states to make work value low a penalty can be applied if the model discards too many states.
this is due to if keep/discard work is decreased reward will increase.
As $reward\propto\frac{1}{work}$
States
Each timestep state is related by being an input to a process and is monotonic
The state is equal to the process with the timestamp as the input
Sn = P(tn)
Domain Knowledge

P is unknown
high rewards are very sparse >1:10000

Attempts so far/Ideas
I have already tried using Bayesian optimisation on this problem with minimal luck.
there are many different types of reinforcement learning algorithms.
The ones applicable are

output is classification(category) for keep/discard
continuous state space -> discrete action space

output is decision boundary(value) for classification
continuous state space -> continuous action space

output is feature(value) which is then classified

"Are platformer games, with the camera centred on the character, examples of egocentric vision?","
An example may be CoinRun, where the character sprite is always centred in the camera view, while the environment moves as a result of player input.
To me, this sounds like egocentric vision, although the wikipedia page seems to rely heavily on the notion of a wearable camera in the definition, and the treatment seems to ignore 2D environments, directly jumping to the 3D case.
If this (CoinRun, other similar platformers, etc.) is indeed not an example of an egocentric vision problem, what is it an example of? Is there a formal way of expressing the difference between platformers where the camera is centred about the character vs platformers where the camera is centred about the environment?
I am particularly interested in this to help me with formalizing differences in environments in an RL context, where environment state is perceived visually, for example through a CNN.

Exponentiation immediately after log softmax,"
In an AlphaZero repo's implementation of Othello game, I see:

At one line: F.log_softmax here
Next line of the control flow: torch.exp here

In other words, this is $\exp \log \sigma(z)$, where $\sigma(z)$ is the softmax function.
I also see this done in a different implementation here.
Is there an advantage to the extra $\exp \log$?  Or is this just extra indirection?

I would like to fine-tune a sentence BERT model using my own dataset and perform a semantic similarity task. When generating the training dataset, I need to generate the embeddings for each sentence in my own dataset.
So I wonder if I can use the same pre-trained sentence BERT model to generate embeddings for my training dataset which I would use to fine-tune the same sentence BERT model afterwards? Is this a form of transfer learning, since I am leveraging the generalized ability of the pretrained model to downstream specific tasks?

I am training an autoencoder meant to detect anomalies. Initially I scaled my data using a min-max scaler. I realized that this scalar isn't the best because anomalies can cause bias in the scalar. Now I've switched to the Robust Scalar. With this change, my learning mean square error has blown up.
It makes sense that the error might be higher because the data isn't nicely scaled between 0 and 1, but 13 orders of magnitude seems high. I've attempted with and without batch normalization right after the input layer but no difference.
Training with min-max scalar results in a validation MSE of .0046.
Training with robust scalar results in a validation MSE of 2,628,451,584
The autoencoder is structured as 63>32>16>8>4>8>16>32>63.
All activations are relu except for the output layer which is linear.

"When to stop training object detection network, while taking into the acount 3 factors: loss ,validation loss, mAP","
as far as I know, and as can be seen here
enter link description here

it is quite clear that it is better to stop at the ""turning point"" where the validation loss starts growing.
What I do not understand is two things:

As can be seen here:

my best mAP is located quite far to the right of the turning point. Is it better to choose a model of option B (located in the overfit zone but the mAP is better), or it is better to choose model A, which is quite in the same area of the turning point, though it's mAP is smaller?

2)More theoretical question:  As far as I understand the mAP and the validation loss both calculated on an unseen dataset - the validation dataset, Thus I do not quite get how technically happens that mAP gets better(grows) while the validation loss gets worse (grows)? Shouldnt they behave quite the same?

Training a neural network to produce a one-hot encoding vector out of a single feature,"
I would like to build a neural network that takes a natural number and generates a one-hot encoding vector corresponding to that number.

Example: $2 \rightarrow (0,0,1,0,\dots)$

More formally, I want it to take an input $i \in [0, \dots, K]$ and produce an output vector $(o_0, \dots, o_j, \dots, o_k)$, where all $o_j$ are 0, except $o_i$, which is 1 (i.e. one-hot encoding).
However, I am not sure on what the specific architecture should be. I believe it should have more than one layer, since there is no linear relationship between the input and the output.
I have tried several architectures, but the best performance I have been able to get is 33%. I am using the following code:

Sorry I made a mistake earlier

Please need to go back
I made a mistake

I first create a torch dataset that feeds the training data
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import os
import json
import csv

class goBackDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, goback_dataset_path = 'goback.txt'):
        super().__init__()

        self.goback_list = []
        self.end_of_text_token = ""<EOS>""
        self.beginning_of_text_token = ""<SOS>""
        
        with open(goback_dataset_path) as csv_file:
            csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file, delimiter=',')
            
            x = 0
            for row in csv_reader:
                goback_str = f""{self.beginning_of_text_token} {row[0]} {self.end_of_text_token}""
                self.goback_list.append(goback_str)
        
    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.goback_list)

    def __getitem__(self, item):
        return self.goback_list[item]

I then initialize the dataset and tokenizers, adding beginning of text and end of text tokens as well as a padding token to ensure all sequences are the same length (as I assume this is necessary?)
import torch
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, AutoTokenizer, GPT2Tokenizer, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from torch.utils.data import TensorDataset

dataset = goBackDataset()
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained('gpt2-large')
tokenizer.add_special_tokens({'bos_token': dataset.beginning_of_text_token, 'eos_token':dataset.end_of_text_token, 'pad_token':""<PAD>""})
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained('gpt2-large')
model.resize_token_embeddings(len(tokenizer))

import numpy as np
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel,  GPT2Tokenizer, GPT2Config, GPT2LMHeadModel
from transformers import AdamW, get_linear_schedule_with_warmup

I then train the model, in batch sizes of 4 (chosen arbitrarily based on the number of samples I have):
epochs = 5
learning_rate = 5e-4
epsilon = 1e-8

optimizer = AdamW(model.parameters(),
                  lr = learning_rate,
                  eps = epsilon
                )

goback_loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)

import torch.nn as nn
softmax = nn.Softmax()

epochs = 2

max_length = 50
model.train()

for epoch in range(epochs):
    combined_loss = 0
    print(f'epoch {epoch}')
    for batch in goback_loader:
        print(batch)
        tokenized = tokenizer(batch, truncation = True, max_length = max_length, padding = 'max_length')
        input_ids = torch.tensor(tokenized['input_ids'][0])
        attention_mask = torch.tensor(tokenized['attention_mask'][0])
        
        model.zero_grad()        
        
        outputs = model(input_ids, labels = input_ids, attention_mask = attention_mask)
        loss = outputs[0]
        combined_loss += loss.item()
        
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print('loss: ', combined_loss)

Yet the desired result is a gibberish of padding tokens and words like ""change my"" strewn in.
The best I could do is by enforcing a limit on the number of repeat, enforcing a small max length, and adding a high temperature, yet it's still a mess:
tokenizer.decode(model.generate(inputs = None,
                                do_sample = True, 
                                max_length = 10, 
                                no_repeat_ngram_size = 1,
                                temperature = 0.9,
                                skip_special_tokens = True)[0])
'<|endoftext|>Could <PAD>  change my interviewI <EOS>  back schedule'

Is GPT-2 not robust enough to handle this task with this amount of data, or am I doing something wrong? It's clearly not ending with <EOS> tokens, and starting with <|endoftext|> and including <PAD>. Is this even expected behavior?

Are the steps where human AI trainers are involved, i.e. training the initial policy and providing the A>B>C>D grading as training sets for the reward model, the ONLY place where actual knowledge is entered? Are there no other learning steps where human trainers are NOT involved and the model learns from high-quality sources like authoritative texts?

How to detect outlier images?,"
Before I describe my challenge, I want to point out that I have searched extensively online for ""outlier image detection"", ""anomaly images detection"", etc., but all returned results are about finding anomalies or outliers within an image (e.g., a defect in a machined part, a tear in fabric, etc.).
This is not what I am looking for: I am looking to identify images (whole images) that depict an object that is different from the other images. For instance, I have a stream of images from a live camera. Each image depicts a single dog (different breeds) and each image is centered on the dog. A few images depict a cat, rather than a dog... I would like to detect these cat images (outliers).
This is not a simple classification problem, where I have a labeled data set of cats and dogs... because I don't want to define the 'outlier'. In other words, the approach must be adaptable to the data: if I were to suddenly add a few images of trash, the model must flag those trash images as novel/outliers because in comparison to the number of dog images, trash images (like cat images) are pretty rare (or new).
Would something like sequential k-means work for this problem? I thought about sequential k-means, since it operates on a data stream and will adapt to the number of clusters (i.e, k does not need to be pre-defined).
What other approaches would work? Any resources (e.g., links to tutorials, GitHub repositories, specific algorithms, methodologies) that might help?

How do temperature and repetition penalty interfere?,"
I'm trying to demystify my understanding of various decoding parameters. Building on our understanding of temperature, how does the repetition penalty interfere with temperature?
For example, does something special happen when the penalty is approximately equal to temperature, or approximately its reciprocal? Does the penalty need to be offset or biased based on the temperature?
","['language-model', 'encoder-decoder']","TL;DR: Temperature is applied after repetition penalty, so it smoothes out its effect.They are basically independent hyper-parameters of the decoding, but applied after each other.Higher temperature makes the output distribution more uniform, so you are likely to get more diverse generations, but at the same time, you risk they will not make sense (in an extreme case, you might even get malformed words).Language models, especially when undertrained, tend to repeat what was previously generated. To prevent this, (an almost forgotten) large LM CTRL introduced the repetition penalty that is now implemented in Huggingface Transformers. It is described in an unnumbered equation in Section 4.1 on page 5:It discounts the probability of tokens that already appeared in the generated text, making them less likely to appear again.Discounting already generated words is implemented as a RepetitionPenaltyLogitsProcessor, and temperature is implemented as TemperatureLogitsWarper in the Transformers library. Processors get applied before Warpers. This means that the effect of discounting of already generated tokens gets smoothed by the temperature smoothing."
Inference time of VGG16 when initialised with different weights,"
I’m trying to understand the differences in inference time and training time between two models:
VGG16 with weights initialised from a Glorot uniform distribution and the same network with the only difference being that weights are initialised to the imagenet values.
Obviously the performance of the latter is higher and training time on my dataset is lower.
However, the training time per epoch is also lower. I’m not sure why this is, I also measured the inference time which was lower and roughly explains the difference in training time. But why would the inference time be lower given that it’s the exact same model with the same number of parameters?
Note that all tests were performed on the same device. VGG16 used was from the Keras library

Is the Mask Needed for Masked Self-Attention During Inference with GPT-2,"
My understanding is that masked self-attention is necessary during training of GPT-2, as otherwise it would be able to directly see the correct next output at each iteration. My question is whether the attention mask is necessary, or even possible, during inference. As GPT-2 will only be producing one token at a time, it doesn't make sense to mask out future tokens that haven't been inferred yet.

"Looking for a reinforcement learning algorithm that deals well with a model-based, curiosity-driven approach for chess AI","
I am a software engineer that meddled with machine learning (classifiers) during my thesis.
After being out of it for a while I decided I want to try and do a neural network project to learn from, specifically reinforcement learning. We'll see how smart is was to try and make a chess AI for my first project but here we go:
I did some research and came to a few conclusions:

I want to make an AI that teaches itself by trial and error, rather than going over lots of previous games. Hence the reinforcement-learning requirement.

It seems far better to provide some basic rules, like possible moves (policies?) for a given position (state, right?), because illegal moves far outnumber legal moves. So it seems like a waste of time and processing power to make it work on lots of useless scenarios (all the illegal move options). Because of this I think I understand that I am looking for an algorithm that learns model-based.

If I understand it correctly my problem has sparse rewards, since a chess game can last for 60 moves easily without a game result. I have pondered using reward shaping to try and deal with this, for example a stockfish (open source chess engine) position evaluation or captured piece values. However it occurs to me that that would result in some pretty nasty drawbacks:

take a lot of time in the case of stockfish (stockfish takes seconds to evaluate a position).
discourage sacrificing pieces in case of using captured piece values. (or would this be overcome by tuning the exploitation vs exploration ratio?)

So it seems like reward shaping is not the way to go. However if I understand it correctly I can use a curiosity-driven approach to get around this?


So to summarize: I think I am looking for an algorithm that does well with a model-based curiosity-driven approach.
Do you agree with my conclusions and if so, can you recommend an algorithm for me to check out? I have searched for algorithms already but it seems to me that this question is a bit specific to just find an answer for on google.

Let's assume a transformer (with both encoder and decoder) is employed for a time-series prediction. I.e. from the input sequence x_0, ..., x_N we want to predict y_0, ..., y_N. Is this the way that parallelization occurs during training?

form the batch [], [y_0], ..., [y_0, ..., y_N-1]
feed this batch to the transformer, together with the input sequence
we will obtain the batch Y_0, Y_1, ..., Y_N
compare against y_0, ..., y_N and form the loss (*)

(*) here, some teacher ratio techiques may be employed, so that more passes may be required

Best feature engineering approach for interest-based age classification,"
I have a dataset which has users (rows) with the list of their interests (IABs), which looks like this
user_id | gender | list of interests
--------+--------+--------------------------------
user 1  | male   | games, productivity
user 2  | female | games, lifestyle, design
user 3  | male   | travel, games, messaging
user 4  | male   | messaging, blogging, lifestyle

Since the number of unique interests are few (~500) and the number of rows are high (~67M), what are the feature engineering practices that I should follow to get an ML model score a better accuracy?
P.S.: Simple model with one hot/count hot vectorization yields an accuracy of ~52%

How to approach a student planning problem?,"
Suppose we have a couple of hundred students that each can select one or two subjects to follow, e.g., math and history. Each student can only attend a single class for each subject. Each student also has a specific availability, e.g.,: ""I am available on Monday class hours 1-4 and Friday class hours 3, 5 and 7"". Obviously a student cannot attend two classes at the same time.
On the other side we have teachers with specific skills. One teacher can only teach physics, and another one can teach math and history. Teachers also have a specific availability. And obviously a teacher cannot teach two classes at the same time.
Question: what algorithm would be best to find a solution to bucket the students in such a way that
a) a planning is possible and
b) the planning is the most optimal by using the least amount of teachers?
I considered using a GA, but the problem is that once you select a student for a specific class (e.g., Monday 2nd hour, history), that student cannot attend that same subject anymore at another time in the week. The rest of the planning is dependent on that choice. This makes it hard to use a cross-over mechanism. For instance you could have two well performing 'parents' that have the same student planned at different times. By crossing them, suddenly the student is planned twice, which is not allowed. So basically the offspring of these parents, would be most probably completely useless. Hence the parents need to be selected not based on their overall fitness, but on how fit they are to breed with other parents in the pool. But that might lead to suboptimal results.
Feel free to share your thoughts on how you would approach this problem! Thanks

The neural network for a board game with somewhat imperfect information,"
I am a Software Engineer and I implemented online a pretty complex board game.
Some key rules of the game.

You have some cards in the hand and you can choose different turns.
Build a card of certain type, which would increase your income or give victory points.
You can choose to receive the resources equal to your income.
You can choose to take more cards.
Some cards that you build have pretty complex effects that can't be measured, some examples are: increase the number of cards you can take during a single turn, a card that lets you make a special turn if you have that card etc.

What I already tried to do.
I tried to create a state of the game that would include

income of every player
current number of resources of every player
current victory points
the state of the game that affects how long it might take till the end
the number of current turn, since it is variable and depends on the play

I would collect this data for every game, then mark which data belongs to a player who won, and who lost and teach the model.
Then I took this model, calculated every possible turn and future state if a player made that turn and then I would evaluate which of those turn would show the highest chance of a win. And then I would consider that turn the most optimal.
The problem with this approach is that it doesn't evaluate those special cards with special effects, because they simply don't fit into that model.
Also the most complex part is that player may choose which cards he wants to take and which cards he wants to discard.
How can I teach the engine to evaluate the value of that card? For example a certain card may be extremely good but there might be some limitations according to player current situation. I don't know how to put this data into the model.
Also I ignore the fact that opposite player can play something, even though I can evaluate his current game situation, because I can see everything he played, or has, except his hand.
In the end I simply made my computer play vs itself and collected data on which cards played on which turn show the best win rate for a player in the end.
But I want to make and teach a model, maybe not by evaluating the board, because I can't fit those complex cards, but maybe some other solution.
Give me please any advice at which approaches/literate to look.

Higher accuracy in the test set than in the training set,"
Hi I'm trying to train an ANN model to classify images containing these characters: 0,1,2,3,4,T,X,S
eg.


etc...
so something like the classification of records of the MNIST dataset but using my generated images (not handwritten).
I generate ~10000 records that have to be divided in the training set and in the test set:
n = 10000
X_train, y_train = generate_typed(typed_alphabet_resized.astype('uint8'), int(n*0.8))
X_test, y_test = generate_typed_test(typed_alphabet_resized.astype('uint8'), int(n*0.3))

generate_typed and generate_typed_test are pretty much the same function, the sole difference is the augmentation applied to images:
for generate_typed_test the only augmentation applied is scale(1,3) while for generate_typed:
augmentation_seq = iaa.Sequential([
    iaa.Sometimes(0.3, iaa.GaussianBlur(sigma=(0, .1))), 
    iaa.Sometimes(0.3, iaa.AdditiveGaussianNoise(loc=0, scale=(0.0, 0.05*255), per_channel=0.2)), 
    iaa.Affine(scale=(1, 3)), 
], random_order=True)

I did that to make the model more generalized as possibile.
But really the kind of images the model is supposed to work on in the real world might just (sometimes) be zoomed in or be slightly less centered.
However even if I use these two different functions, the images I got are very very similar.
Now, the problem is: I got a bigger accuracy on the test set than on the training set, and I really can't understand why and how to fix it.
It seems like that the accuracy of my model doesn't matter, if my model has around 80% of accuracy or 95% of accuracy, I still got an 0.9997 on test set (bigger than the accuracy during the training).
Note: Even if I apply the same type of trasformations on the train and test set, or if I apply no trasformation to both sets nothing changes.
I'm not saying the model doesn't work, but it's really wrong quite often.
I don't know if this means overfitting or not, but I don't think so because loss & accuracy doesn't intersect each other:

Model:
model3 = Sequential([
  Flatten(input_shape=(28,28,1)), # ""appiattisco"" l'immagine
  Dense(20, activation='relu'), # creo uno strato denso la cui funzione di attivazione è relu
  Dropout(0.5), # Spengo a caso dei neuroni (per evitare overfitting)
  Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax') # strato denso di 10 neuroni con funzione di attivazione softmax (perchè è un classificatore)
])

model3.compile(
    loss = 'sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
    metrics=['accuracy'],
    optimizer=Adam(lr=0.01)
)


X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X_train, y_train, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)
model3.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=5, batch_size = 5, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), callbacks=[early_stop])

Why is a bias parameter needed in neural networks?,"
I have read several resources, including previously asked questions such as this. I have also read arguments related to intercepts needed to separate linearly separable data. If my neural network can perform feature transformation, what is the need of a bias term?
Since the weights are learnt, my network can optimise to fit the data. For example, if my data is in 2D coordinate plane, my equation without bias for a perceptron for the layer will be $W_1X_1 + W_2X_2$ where $X_1$ is x coordinate and $X_2$ is y coordinate, making $W_1$ and $W_2$ coefficients of all vectors along x and y direction. Their linear combination will cover the whole plane which allows my data to be transformed across a line with 0 intercept.
For example, if my weight is 1.0 for input x, and my bias is 0.1, I might as well have weight $1+(0.1/\bar x)$ (or any other value descriptive of x) and 0 bias to get the same result.
Similar things happen for the arguments related to activation mentioned in the marked solution to the referenced question.
In such a scenario, why is the bias needed?
Edit: A lot of the answers offer reasonable arguments for the perceptron/single layer case, but perceptron was just an example. Do they hold for deep neural networks as well, because that allows for previous layers better transformation of inputs? As mentioned by some, 0 input will truly cause a problem which I agree with.

How to add a neural network to a direct optimization algorithm,"
I want to improve a direct optimization algorithm with neural network. The original algorithm is called LIVE, as follows:
input: RGB Image (H*W*3)
output: SVG graphic (list of bezier curve with fill-color properties)

P = [] //list of path control points
C = [] //list of path colors

for n in max_path do:
  p, c = random_init()
  P = concat([P; p])
  C = concat([C; c])

  for j = 1 to max_iter do:
    I = render(P,C)
    L = loss between I and input
    optimize P, C based on L

Here, I want to replace random_init() with a CNN taking the target image and the previous rendered image as input, hoping that the algorithm can use lesser iterations to achieve the same loss. The problem I have now is, if I store previous path and color tensors as output of the model from previous steps, the model will calculate gradients for all of them during a step. My other option is to store a copy of tensors detached from the graph instead, but I am not sure which makes the most sense here.
Any pointers is appreciated.

This might be the wrong place to ask, but I was curious what it looks like if you're watching the neural network as it's running. Can you see it changing in real time in some tangible sense, or is it all hidden except for the outcome?
I've tried searching for this answer on Google, however all I've found are resources on how to make one, or the general structure of it all, but not what it actually looks like.
","['neural-networks', 'ai-design']","Neural networks in practice don't look like anything.When teaching about neural networks we may draw pictures of circles connected by lines, but this is for teaching the general idea, and any useful neural network is way too big - too many circles and too many lines - to actually draw. When they are drawn they usually show big components - at the smallest, one would draw each individual layers of neurons, or entire sections of the network, as a box or some kind of squiggly cloud, depending on what the illustrator feels like. Examples: page 5 here (AlexNet; top of picture seems to be cut off) or page 3 here (Transformer) or page 3 here (VQGAN). These illustrations are supplementary to the (highly technical) writing to understand the design of the network.When you are designing a neural network you don't draw pictures; you use code to put the pieces together.When you run the training algorithm it looks like nothing really - just a progress bar going across the screen 100 times as slowly as you'd like - and sounds like annoyingly loud cooling fans under your desk.If you are classifying cats from dogs, or digits, or whatever, your feedback is just a number on the screen called something like ""loss"" or ""error"" that hopefully goes down with each cycle. Actually, you would display this in all cases. Every neural network has a loss value and it's always supposed to go down. If you're doing something particularly complex like a GAN, you might have two loss values (oooh spooky).Depending on what your network is doing, you might program it to display samples of its work every so often. If you are training a neural network to recognize things, there is probably nothing sensible to output besides the loss value and what percentage were correct. However if you are creating something like DALL-E, you may program it to create a picture each time it finishes a training cycle (that can be 30 seconds up to several minutes). If you are creating something like ChatGPT you may program it to write a paragraph after each cycle. Then you can get an idea of whether it's working, so that if the training isn't achieving anything, you can end it early, instead of waiting for it to finish, before you play around with the code some more.But most neural networks aren't DALL-E or ChatGPT, so in most cases you just see a progress bar and some numbers."
Vector based information retrieval on code resulting in high correlation values for all candidates,"
The aglo:
So currently I am writing an algorithm that scans over a code base and uses the ""text-embedding-ada-002"" model from open ai, to turn each code line into a vector. Then I also use the same model to embed a natural language query ""Where is the search functionality housed?"". Then I simply run a linear search and compare the cosine similarity between the query vector and each code line vector. Then I simply take the topk results.
The issue:
I notice that seemingly all code lines have high cosine similarity scores (greater than .6). I tried extending the window in which i embed 1 -> 10 lines at a time. But they all still seem high. Also it biases heavily towards natural language documents like the readme. Any ideas on how I can improve this ? Maybe some low hanging fruit that i'm missing ?

Will a CNN that is Group Equivariant always be better than a regular CNN?,"
I am reading this paper about Group Equivariant Convolutional Networks. Basically, it is a CNN whose construction makes the network naturally equivariant to Group transformations (e.g. rotations) of the input.
This is, a GE-CNN trained with the Rotations Group in its architecture, will for instance predict correctly the label of a rotated MNIST digit, even though it was never trained on rotated MNIST digits.
My question here is, are there any situations in which these GE-CNN will not perform better than a regular CNN? In other words: is the property of being equivariant to any transformation of the input always desirable?
",['convolutional-neural-networks'],"No, it will very much depend on the specific domain that you're applying the model to, whether or not this type of prior will be good or bad. The same applies to any other prior structure/knowledge you could encode in networks.For example, the basic CNNs implement the prior assumption of shift invariance. Intuitively, you may think of this as saying ""if I can learn to recognise a cat (or anything else) in one location of an image, I can generalise from this and immediately also recognise cats in different locations of images"". This tends to work well, because it is true: cats do look like cats, regardless of where they are in an image.The same reasoning applies to the prior assumption of rotation invariance (or equivariance): whether it is helpful or harmful depends on the domain. I would actually argue that the very same MNIST digit recognition problem that you mention as an example in your question is a problem where you do not want rotation invariance. Just think of the digits 6 and 9: if you rotate one of those upside down, it looks identical to the other. So, a neural network with rotation invariance will never be able to distinguish between sixes and nines!"

Typical FLOPs for training and hyperparameter tuning of standard models?,"
I am trying to find estimates of the typical FLOPs required for training a modern model. The FLOPs used for inference are widely reported and cluster around $10^6$ - $10^7$ for many large models. However, I cannot find equivalent stats for training; the best I can do is guess an order of magnitude based on the number of training epochs times the number of training data points times the inference FLOPs.
When I do this, I estimate that AlexNet and its contemporaries would have required about $10^{18}$ FLOPs.
Is this the right order of magnitude? How many FLOPs do modern networks typically require for all stages of training (I'm also interested in estimates that include hyperparameter tuning)?

Why optimise log p(x) rather than log p(x|z) in a Variational AutoEncoder?,"
Background
The loss function in a Variational AutoEncoder is the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO):
$\mathbb{E}_q[log$ $p(x|z)] - KL[q(z)||p(z)]$
And has this inequality:
$log$ $p(x) \ge \mathbb{E}_q[log$ $p(x|z)] - KL[q(z)||p(z)]$
It is said in the literature that we want to maximise $log$ $p(x)$, but instead, we maximise the ELBO, which we know is less than or equal to $log$ $p(x)$ (because this is an easier objective).
First Question
I am struggling to understand why the objective is to maximise $log$ $p(x)$ in the first place.
Why is it not enough to maximise $\mathbb{E}_q[log$ $p(x|z)]$, which is the reconstruction loss?
I think I don't understand what exactly $p(x)$ means here.
I thought $p(x)$ was just the distribution of $x$, which are the input variables we have observed.
So how can we maximise $p(x)$, if it is the actual distribution of data in the real world?
Main Question
The Variational AutoEncoder is trying to learn an encoding from $x$ to $z$ and decoding from $z$ to $x'$, such that the difference between $x$ and $x'$ is minimized.
How does $log$ $p(x)$ relate to this?
What does it mean and how does maximising it help?

Consider a random variable $x_{ijk}$, where $ijk$ is a subscript that indicates that the variable varies with 3 dimensions (e.g., firm, product, and country). $x_{ijk}$ is known to be i.i.d. log-normally distributed.
How to find the distribution of $x_{ijk}$ where $k$ is fixed? Is $x_{ijk}$ still an i.i.d. drawn sample and is $x_{ijk}$ still lognormally distributed?

Dimensionality Limitations,"
I just started learning about AI and have been reading a book called ""Foundations of Machine Learning"" by Mehryar Mohri so that I can try to create my own. I had a question come up recently: Can I create a machine learning algorithm that can reasonably solve high dimensional problems?
For example, say I want to find a local maximum within a specified range for $Y$, but $Y$ is a function of $x_1,...x_{30}$ functions. And I call $x_i$ a function because it relies on all other $x$ functions such that for $x_{i=n}$, this is a function of all $x_{i \neq n}$. So there are 30 dimensions that the algo can alter and each variable is also a function of the other.
I looked up online about dimensional issues with AI and found a pretty good, simple article outlining why AI accuracy decreases with dimensionality increasing. The article was written a couple of years ago though and I wanted to see if anyone knew if research since then has found a machine learning method to get around this problem. If not, what are ways to say interpolate or minimize the error, besides a ton of training data or what the article recommends: dimensionality reduction prior to training?
PS - Please delve into the applied analysis that underlies whatever answer you may have!

why by adding additional information as number of sequence on dataset can avoid overfitting,"
I am developing a regression model to analyze walking styles. The dataset I am using to build the model is from 2 different sources, let's call them dataset A and dataset B.
Dataset A has a shape of (15000,6) and dataset B has a shape of (15000,89). Both datasets are time-series data taken simultaneously for 5 minutes. I then trained the data using input data of shape (15000,89,1). The loss and val_loss generated from the training process were very small, but when I tested it using real data, the model was unable to predict the real data. Therefore, I think I am experiencing overfitting.
Then I tried adding new data to the input data. This new data is a sequence number from 1-50. I added this sequence number as an identity to the input data because the data I will generate will have 50 data in 1 second. I only added this sequence number to the input data. So the input data that was originally (15000,89,1) became (15000,90,1). Then after adding this sequence number, I trained the new input data, and the result was better than before, and the model was able to predict real data. My question is, why is the technique of adding a sequence number to the input data able to avoid overfitting? Is the additional information of the sequence number part of data augmentation? If yes, please give me logical reasons and relevant references because I can't find relevant references and it is hard to find keywords for them.

How do derive the time complexity of alpha beta pruning,"
I think I understand how the time complexity of minimax was derived, I believe it is basically the same as the uniformed Breadth- first search algorithm which is:

In terms of time and space, imagine searching a uniform tree where
every state has $b$ successors. The root of the search tree generates $b$
nodes, each of which generates $b$ more nodes, for a total of $b^2$ at the
second level. Each of these generates $b$ more nodes, yielding $b^3$ nodes
at the third level, and so on. Now suppose that the solution is at
depth $d$. Then the total number of nodes generated is:
$1+b$+ $b^2$+ $b^3$ $+ ...+{b^d} = O({b^d}) $
All the nodes remain in memory, so both time and space complexity are $O(b^d)$.

But I do not understand how the time complexity of alpha-beta pruning was derived and it was not explained in AIMA. On Wikipedia, they have an explanation that says:

With an (average or constant) branching factor of b, and a search
depth of d plies, the maximum number of leaf node positions evaluated
(when the move ordering is pessimal) is O(b×b×...×b) = $O(b^d)$ – the
same as a simple minimax search. If the move ordering for the search
is optimal (meaning the best moves are always searched first), the
number of leaf node positions evaluated is about O(b×1×b×1×...×b) for
odd depth and O(b×1×b×1×...×1) for even depth, or $O(b^{d/2})$ = O($\sqrt{b^d}$). In the latter case, where the ply of
a search is even, the effective branching factor is reduced to its
square root, or, equivalently, the search can go twice as deep with
the same amount of computation.[13] The explanation of b×1×b×1×... is
that all the first player's moves must be studied to find the best
one, but for each, only the second player's best move is needed to
refute all but the first (and best) first player move—alpha–beta
ensures no other second player moves need be considered.

I think I kind of understand the skipping of all but the best of the second player's move but I don't understand how that was used to derive the time complexity. I'm even a bit lost on how they used $O(b×b×...×b)$ to derive the time complexity of minimax

I am confused of derivation steps of MAP for linear regression,"

Could you explain the two steps I marked on the slides? For the first step, I thought $P(beta|X,y) = \frac{P(X,y|beta)P(beta)}{P(X,y)}$ but I don't know the further steps to reach the next step. Maybe I am confused of the conditional notation and semicolon notation.

Now, the two key steps. First, $p(\beta | X) = p(\beta)$ if $X$ and $\beta$ are independent (why is this the case?). Second, $p(y |X)$ is constant in $\beta$. How does multiplying a function by a constant affect the location of its maximum?For step 2: simply substitute the expressions given for $p(y|X, \beta)$ and $p(\beta)$. There will be additional terms that don't depend on $\beta$. How does adding a constant to a function affect the location of its maximum?"
Regressing parameters that map between two curves machine learning,"
I am wondering if anyone has experience in regressing out parameters that map one curve to another. For example, I have two curves that look like this. I used some non-linear equation to map orange to blue. I am varying the exact orange curve (and hence blue) each time, but the mapping between them is the same (i.e., same function). Does anyone have experience in using machine learning to re-extract these parameters, presumably via regression? Specifically, there are three parameters of interest that went into mapping orange to blue. I have tried using a 2-channel CNN (one channel orange, one blue), and had a bit of success but even in perfect data like this it doesn't achieve a decent accuracy (i.e., mean absolute error). I also tried a transformer but it performed much worse, although I have less experience with these so probably the architecture wasn't suitable. Any one have any other ideas?

"Why does the pass@k metric not ""behave like"" probability?","
pass@k is a metric used to evaluate models that generate code, used for example to evaluate Codex. To evaluate pass@k, you have a dataset of natural language/code pairs, and you pass each NL prompt to the model. For each prompt, it generates k code snippets. If at least one of the code snippets is correct, then the model succeeded at that prompt in k samples. The pass@k is the fraction of prompts for which the model succeeded in this sense.
The samples generated for each prompt are obtained via some stochastic procedure based on the model's output probability distributions on the vocabulary, like randomly choosing the next token based on that distribution or something like that.
So in the Codex paper for example, we see these figures for the largest Codex model:

pass@1: 28%
pass@100: 72%

These numbers make no sense to me. Every time we sample the model's prediction for a given prompt, we get back a random code snippet. That output is either correct or incorrect. Each trial is independent. So if the probability of one output being correct is p, the probability of at least one of 100 being correct should be 1 - (1 - p)^100. Here p=0.28, so the pass@100 should be like 99.999999%.
Are the trials not independent? What's going on?
","['transformer', 'metric']","Very late to this question, but pass@k doesn't behave like you're describing because each single pass@k sample is itself a union of k independent events, so averaging them doesn't behave like a union of (num samples) independent events.Here's an illustration. Say our dataset is two samples, such that on sample 1 our model always gets it right, and on sample 2 our model never gets it right. Then pass@1 = 50%. But doing 100 passes on each sample, we get 100 correct answers on sample 1 (counts as correct) and 0 correct answers on sample 2 (counts as incorrect). Then pass@100 = 50%. In fact pass@k = 50% for any k in this toy setting."
Prioritized experience replay correction with off-policy estimators,"
Prioritized exeperience replay (PER) biases the sampling and introduces importance sampling (IS) correction to the Q-function update.
Weights are $w = \frac{1}{N P}^\beta$, where $N$ is the batch size and $P$ is the sampling probability.
Off-policy estimators like Retrace and V-Trace also use IS correction between the behavior and the target policy. Weights are $w = \pi / \mu$, where $\pi$ is the target policy and $\mu$ is the behavior policy. Weights are further clipped.
Recent methods like APE-X, Reactor, and LASER combine both techniques: they use a replay memory where n-step samples are drawn to compute value function target with off-policy estimators.
However, it is unclear to me how they combine off-policy correction and PER correction.
How are weights from off-policy estimators and weights from PER combined in methods like APE-X, Reactor, and LASER?

Creating a support chat bot for my business,"
I am trying to create a kind of Support Bot to answer my clients about specific technical details about WordPress plugins that I sell.
The goal is that the /completitions api would be feeded a prompt which could be something general like a CSS styling change which the davinci engine knows without any specific data about my business, but the customer might ask something specific for which I have about a data set of 3000 questions and answers ( prompts / completions ? input / output ? ) on which the bot can feed on. - exactly like this awesome example here
I am a web developer and I don't have experience with AI. I am just scratching the surface trying to put this bot together learning concepts like Machine Learning, Training Data, Validation Set, Plotting, Neural Network. So bear with me cause it's a lot to grasp :pleading_face:
So first of all, I did a lot of documenting and getting an API key from OPENAI is certainly the first step.
Then I told ChatGPT my story and what I tried to achieve, I asked him to write in PHP preferably , but it always ends up hallucinating so could not really use anything he generated without adjusting. And the further I asked him about specifics, the further he hallucinated.
So I read a lot of documentation and extrapolating with what I got from ChatGPT I think there are 3 ways to achieve this:

fine tuned model
uploading a training set and a validation set
embeddings api ( which the example that I linked uses )

Understanding that most examples are on Python, I started mlq.ai/gpt-3-fine-tuning-key-concepts/ tutorial - then I prepared with fine-tunes.prepare DATA_UNDER_COMMENT into the json by line to be categorised in prompt and completions
Then, I used openai api fine_tunes.create -t  to create my fine-tune
and now I have my fine-tune created and I run
openai.Completion.create(
    model=FINE_TUNED_MODEL,
    prompt=YOUR_PROMPT)

this looked like the way to go, but even if put a basic question that was actually in the JSONL, it's like the engine forgot to talk and outputs random characters
so I tried another approach from the cookbook which seems pretty great - following this which seems exactly like what I want to achieve .

Blockquote The GPT models have picked up a lot of general knowledge in training, but we often need to ingest and use a large library of more specific information.

I tried to use the code there, but with my CSV hosted online I got a 406 response when trying to load
Then I stored the CSV locally, and it complained that a column ( tokens ) was not available for converting to int ( 10 )
Then from what I could understand I switched from using load_embeddings to compute_doc_embeddings because it says from the documentation that they already have the embedding generated for that CSV
I did that, but now it asks for a json instated of CSV
Of course, I am able to provide my data in any format, so when I tried to load my data it says that the token limit of 8000 is exceeded for this request
I now try to input a small json here - under a comment
and try to run a prompt. And, kind of amazing, after hours of work, it seems to work. I provide a question from the data, but under a different structure and it replies to me correctly, using a different wording than the one from the json data.
he could have not known this from the general knowledge.
so this is what I want to achieve, but my data set is much larger.
I need help to understand if my approach is correct . And if Embedding is the way to go , how to feed data into OpenAI and reference that embeddings set when doing api calls to completions. Ideally I would have those embeddings stored somehow with the possibility to add to them. Just like I have fine tune sets or files under my API account.

Can NEAT produce output which has no connection with any other node?,"

I recently developed a little tool called Neat Cars where you can drawa track, place a car and watch the NEAT algorithm in action (including the ANN).
However, I saw something that caught my attention:

Of course, the first thing I did why asking ChatGPT after seeing this as I don't think the drawing is lying. It gave me this exact explaination:

In NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies), it is possible for an output node to have no connections with any other node in the neural network but still produce an output. This can happen when the output node is initially connected to an input node or when it is connected to a hidden node that later becomes disconnected from the network.
When a neural network is evolving through NEAT, the algorithm may add or remove connections or nodes during the optimization process. If a connection between the output node and other nodes is removed, the output node can still produce an output because it may have learned to do so during previous generations or training iterations.
Additionally, in NEAT, some output nodes may be designated as ""structural"" nodes, which means they are always included in the network regardless of their connectivity. These structural nodes can also produce outputs even if they are not connected to any other nodes.
In summary, while it is not common in traditional neural network architectures for an output node to produce output without any input connections, it is possible in NEAT due to the way the algorithm evolves and optimizes neural networks.

But still, I don't think it works that way. I'm still having doubts.
","['neural-networks', 'python', 'neat']","To answer the main question:Can NEAT produce output which has no connection with any other node?Yes. This is a common property of most artificial neurons, and not really to do with NEAT.If you have a set of inputs to an artificial neuron $x_i$, weighted by weights $w_i$, and the output is $y$, then one way to write the function for a single neuron is:$$y = f(b + \sum_{\forall i}w_i x_i)$$where $f$ is the activation function (in your case you have said this is $\text{tanh}$) and $b$ is the neuron's bias. The many other ways of writing this are usually to allow for looking at the larger structure of the network, and are equivalent when you consider just one neuron.Your disconnected neurons have an empty set of inputs, but that is not a problem for typical NN code used in NEAT. It means the NN's function in your case is $y = \text{tanh}(b)$, which will be the same value no matter what the rest of the network does.As your action decision is an $\text{argmax}$ over all outputs, and the other outputs can vary, sometimes they will be lower than the fixed value, and in fact the neural network does not lose any major ability by having such a default for one of its outputs. NEAT networks do tend towards simplicity and can evolve to drop connections that are non-necessary.However, if two outputs were disconnected then one action would never be selected, which would result in poor performance in this problem (although you could potentially have all turns in the same direction for some tracks, or maybe no need to brake).Of course, the first thing I did why asking ChatGPTI recommend that you do not do this for anything important. ChatGPT when asked to explain technical things will output ""explainy"" text with some facts, some errors and a word salad of ideas that roughly link to your technical subject. Its answer to you that you quoted is basically nonsense with a few facts thrown in that are not explanatory for your question. Maybe a future version will be better at explaining technical subjects, but this version is not good for that use, and you will waste time trying to understand nonsense."

This model performs okay both in training and on validation (accuracy could reach to 100% for both). However, when I changed the output length of the input sequence in the first layer's (i.e the embedding layer) from 15 to 100, then its performance became worse. In fact, its accuracy could hardly reach 50% and training was also very slow. Here you can find the updated version of the model and related code.
Examining the data, I found that roughly 44.5% of training examples have lengths greater than 100.  So I guess it's not unreasonable to pad or truncate sequences to length 100. Also some sources say that we could pad all sequences to the length of the longest sequence in dataset and 100 is clearly not the longest sequence's length in this case.
So are there some guidelines or best practices for choosing the value for this parameter?

Face variants from a unique artificial human face? (Person for presentation),"
If an AI human face generator produces a pretty picture, is there a way to use it as a base for GANs to generate more variants from only that one face in different life conditions?
Furthermore: using all the face-variants as a dataset for training a model. (intention of videos; example below)
I guess it comes down to an interplay of different GANs like DCGAN, StyleGAN, etc.
Example for an applicable case:

A designer of clothes needs a person who is wearing those for presentation.
AI is generating a lot of pictures of human faces. I've identified a fitting one and call it actress#1.
For presenting other clothes/hats I need actress#1 in different settings: Head pose/angle, sometimes hair open/tied, haircut, showing different emotions (smile, joy, serious, snotty).

The problem with existing human face generators is, they generate always a new face.
My goal is, if I spotted a pretty face, I want to use it as the base. So the face generator wont generate a new face, instead a new variant of the existing base face.
Next step would be, to train a model from that generated faces of actress#1 in order to make short video clips to demonstrate the clothing for e.g. on a catwalk.
This should be possible, because the GAN who produced the pretty face of actress#1 knows the ""layer-way"" or parameters (head shape, eye-shape, mouth-shape, {hair,eye}-color) used, that lead to it.
Therefore I adjust the AI-face-generator to only use that params for generation?
Is this feasible or do you have a different approach in mind?
Thanks in advance.
P.S.: Open to question if this is even possible with just a single image saved from an AI face generator where nothing is known about the used GAN, params. Just generating the face variants from only that single image as input.

More specifically, I don't understand how the TD-Error ($\delta$) is calculated in the inner loop.
Why are the weights substracted from the Reward?
I understand that just 1 is added to $z_{i}$ (because the Features are binary), but why is there no $\lambda$ in z and why is it not discounted?
I think, I just don't understand the inner loop in general.
In the Semi-gradient TD($\lambda$)-Algorithm (Page 315), z used to be $\gamma$$\lambda$z + $\nabla$$\hat{v}$(S,w).
And $\delta$ used to be R + $\gamma$$\hat{v}$(S',w) - $\hat{v}$(S,w) .
That is better understandable to me.

I want to build a neural network that can read the sequence of elements (likely via 1D convolution and subsequent dense layers?), and make a prediction as to which element is the 'element of interest', which corresponds to a particular position in the original time series.
I am not sure if I am going about structure this the right way, so I wanted to ask if this looks roughly correct. The network should ideally read this input tensor, consider each element's features in the context of adjacent elements' features and then associate a fractional probability that a particular element (say, the green one, in the image) is the one I care about.

Step 1 takes a time series, finds point of interests, and associated features with those points. This step may find anywhere between 1 and 12 points of interest.
Step 2, should ideally look at each point of interest, and figure out which one is the ""true"" one, based on its local and global environment in the encoded input tensor.
I hope this makes sense, I am not a deep learning expert by any means, but I have done some work in the past with CNNs, so please let me know if any additional information would be helpful.

"Question about ""unsupervised learning objective"" in the GPT-2 paper","
I find it difficult to understand the following from the GPT-2 paper.

Language modeling is also able to, in principle, learn the tasks of McCann et al. (2018) without the need for explicit supervision of which symbols are the outputs to be predicted. Since the supervised objective is the the same as the unsupervised objective but only evaluated on a subset of the sequence, the global minimum of the unsupervised objective is also the global minimum of the supervised objective.

I assume the supervised objective is some loss function if we are to train on labeled data sets that look like (task, input) -> output.  But what is the unsupervised objective here?
And why does it say that the supervised objective is only evaluated on a subset of the sequence? My understanding is that GPT-2 is never specifically trained on some of these tasks. So how can it  say that it is evaluated on a subset of the sequence?
I would appreciate if someone helps me understand.

I want to pursue Machine Learning and Data Science as a future career and wanted to get your advice on a good second language that will be useful in the ML field. Currently, I am learning Python and using libraries such as Pandas and Tensorflow to create some practical projects. However, for a job, I feel like I would need a second language to supplement Python. What recommendation do you guys have for a second language? Additionally, if you know of any resources or materials that could help me accelerate my learning in this area, I would appreciate any recommendations you may have.

Dealing with long running tasks in Q Learning,"
Assuming Q Learning is applied not to low level behaviors (such as taking a step; drawing/playing a card; moving one piece on a board), but rather longer running high-level behaviors (e.g. Moving from one point on a grid to another; Hunting prey in a predator-prey simulation; Picking up and delivering a package for a delivery robot).
What would the update of a Q-Value for a given state-action pair look like after one tick of learning, assuming the states of the agent have not changed and their behavior is not finished? In contrast: we can assume that a behavior failing or succeeding, causes the appropriate reward value to be applied since their will likely be a state transition.
In this case is it worth to also store the state of the action in the Q-table?

How to create/train a binary classification model for checking candidate phrases?,"
Let's say I have sentences like ""He called me a silly sausage when I made a stupid joke"", and I want to identify/extract all swear words and the like (here: ""silly sausage"").
I could, of course, set this up as a sequence labeling task. However, can this also be done as a binary classification task where the model gets the sentence as well as a candidate phrase, and the model predicts whether this candidate phrase is a swear word or not.
I know how to do this with traditional models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Logistic Regression):

extract word/phrase features for the candidate given the sentence
Train a model on the predicted features, or use extracted features for the prediction.

But how can I do this in an end-to-end fashion using a CNN or RNN model, for example?

Why most of VAE implementations for image reconstruction use a deterministic decoder?,"
The decoder of VAE is a parameterized distribution $p_{\theta}(\mathbb{x} | \mathbb{z})$ by definition, from which we can sample an output $\hat{\mathbb{x}}$ with an input $\mathbb{x}$ and a sampled latent variable $\mathbb{z}$. However, why most implementations take the decoder as a deterministic function $f(\mathbb{z})$ for reconstructing an image? Wouldn't it be dangerous if the dimension of latent space is too small (e.g. 1), cause it is likely to have overlapped output. And from a perspective of mathematics, the deterministic decoder is not well-defined, since such a single point distribution would be a dirac-delta distribution, which pushes all mass at a point resulting log probability infinitely large, breaking the ELBO.

Now, imagine a game where two players (player 1 always starts the game and both players start with reward = 0) take turns choosing and flipping coins while tallying their score (player 1 always starts) : the first player to reach a reward = + 10 wins and the first player to reach a reward = -10 loses.
However now, imagine the following modification: At the start of the game - the success probabilities and rewards are unknown to both players. The players follow an ""exploration-exploitation paradigm"" where they try to estimate the probabilities and rewards of different coins based on the data they observe and the data of the other player - and then make decisions regarding what coin to pick based on the current state of the game.
My Question: I would like to learn how AI algorithms like Reinforcement Learning (e.g. Q-Learning, Monte Carlo Tree Search, etc.) can be used to develop strategies for optimally playing this game as more information about probabilities/rewards becomes known while the state of the game evolves (e.g. if a player is about to win, the other player might take a risk-averse decision and flip coins he knows have higher payoffs but lesser probabilities of success).
Conceptually, I think it might be possible to design a random simulation in which both players play this game randomly again and again - and then try to incorporate different strategies based on Reinforcement Learning. I thought of two scenarios:

Scenario 1: The probabilities and rewards stay the same in each game - in this scenario, perhaps the AI algorithm will eventually play enough in which success probabilities and rewards can be reliably estimated and an optimal policy can then be estimated
Scenario 2: The probabilities and rewards are reset after each game - in this scenario, perhaps an AI algorithm can learn at what points is it better to explore vs stick to low risk strategies

I have never worked with Reinforcement Learning before - can someone please show me how Python libraries can be used to paly this game using Reinforcement Learning algorithms?
Thanks!

predict a one-hot vector which sum is 2 (so not really a one-hot vector),"
So I basically have a $n$ classes. I have an input. My data is organised in the following way: each input has a label, this label is 2 classes. It can be twice the same class, or two different classes.
So I want to output a vector with only 0s, 1s and 2s which sum is 2. Similarly to what we would do if the label is only one class in a regular classification model. I'm just a bit confused about how we would handle the standard the prediction is the argmax because here we would have to make arbitrary rules about when to predict 2 classes and when to predict two distinct classes (like in this case [0, 0.5, 0.4, 1.1, 0, 0], it's a bit hard to determine if class 4 is predicted twice or if it's one time class 2 and one time class 4, etc ...)
Is this a thing, is there a scientific term about it? Am I not supposed to do that because it breaks something fundamental about classifiers?

How does FaceNet (or similar) bootstrap new faces?,"
In a metric learning system the system can be trained on known examples such that common classes (faces) are clustered together and separated from each other as much as possible. If triplet loss is used, the variance of each cluster is encouraged to be only as small as it needs to be to separate itself from other classes.
When a new face is introduced to the trained system, we can tell that it doesn't belong to any given classes because it is statistically far from any known classes - as determined by their known variance.
So now we make a new class for this face, but with only one example we don't have anything to go one to know what counts as close when checking against it in the future.
How is this bootstrapping managed?

How much do we know about the architectures of the Codex (prototype) models?,"
The transformer model Codex by OpenAI was introduced in a 2021 paper. The paper does not give complete information about the architecture. Below I've quoted all the passages in the paper that give hints as to the architecture:

...we hypothesized that a specialized GPT model, called Codex, could excel at a variety of coding tasks. This paper describes several early Codex models, whose descendants power GitHub Copilot and the Codex models in the OpenAI API.


We fine-tune GPT models containing up to 12B parameters on code to produce Codex.


...we hypothesized that it would be beneficial to fine-tune from the GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) model family...

A table in the paper (Table 1) lists various Codex models studied in the paper, giving only the number of parameters for each one: 12M, 25M, 42M, 85M, 300M, 679M, 2.5B, and 12B.
So, what we can glean from this is: the models discussed in the paper are not the production Codex model that powers Copilot, but prototypes (so the production model could in theory be completely different - that's fine, I'm not asking about that one). A number of different size versions of the model are studied in this paper, and the only description of their architecture is that they are ""GPT models"".
I'm not sure if this is underspecified, or if I just don't know the field well enough. Saying a model is ""a GPT model"" does not seem to specify the architecture uniquely, to me. I know I can go read the GPT-3 paper for more information, but at minimum if you say something is say a 300M parameter ""GPT-3 model"", it seems to me I still don't know how many layers there are, how many attention heads, etc.
Can we deduce more about the shapes of these models? At least the number of layers and parameters per layer?

What method to use for Monte-Carlo Tree Search to prefer depth search,"
The basic Monte-Carlo Tree Search algorithm uses the tree policy:
while v is nonterminal:
  if v is not fully expanded:
    expand v
  else:
    v = v.best_child

By always expanding a node as long as it is expandable a lot of time is consumed to explore the direct next move. When there are a large number of possible moves it can be time (and space) consuming to create nodes for all move candidates and if many of them may have similar outcome it would be preferable to descend in existing subtrees even when the node is not fully expanded yet.
The closest related method that I found is first-play urgency, but as far as I see it also creates the nodes for the actions and also only modifies the algorithm which children are selected to use more exploitation than exploration, but doesn't reduce the amount of move candidates that are created when inserting a node.
I thought about removing the check if the node is expandable and treating it like its children, but I think the UCT of a parent node doesn't get larger than the UCT of its best child because the values of the children are propagated to the parent and the visit count of the parent is always larger than the visit counts of the children, so the parent node would not be selected again later.
Should I try to find a modification for the UCT or are there other methods to allow for exploring subtrees of not fully expanded nodes while still allowing to further expand the parent node from time to time?
Another alternative would be to stochastically only generate a subset of all possible moves at the risk of missing out on a good move, so I would prefer to find a modification of UCT or the descend / expansion algorithms to revisit inner nodes that are still expandable.

Keypoint generation in 3D point clouds with Deep Learning,"
I have a huge dataset of 3D point clouds (each point consists of X,Y,Z coordinates) and another dataset with keypoints (also X,Y,Z) which lie on quite recognizable structures in the point cloud. As a human it is pretty easy to find these keypoint given the according point cloud.
There are 6-24 keypoints for each point cloud which may have up to 100.000 points but can be downsampled to fit into memory while processing.
My goal is to train a supervised deep learning model to detect/generate these keypoints in new point clouds. These have to be new synthetic points since the keypoints are most likely not in my point cloud.
Previously i tried to train a regression model using PointNet++ semantic segmentation. I generated weights for each point in the input point cloud according to its proximity to the next keypoint. For new point clouds the weights were predicted pretty well but it is very difficult to regenerate the synthetic keypoints from these weights since the area around the keypoint can be very sparse.
Essentially i am trying to use a model like this RSN on 3D point clouds to detect synthetic keypoints in the data. I thought about using object detection models like VoxelNet but these detect bounding boxes and i want to get a single predicted point as a result.
I am also wondering if its worth looking into GANs but i dont have experience with these models and until now i only found models who generate a whole new point cloud instead of a single points inside a given point cloud.
I would love to hear some ideas from you to point me in the right direction.

How can a neural network learn to predict shapes or sets using only sampled points?,"
For $t=0,1,\dots$, consider a parameter $x_t \in ${$1, \dots, n$}, where $n \in \mathbb{N}$, and a shape $S(x_t)$ on an $m \times m$ square grid $G$. Let's denote the status of a cell $(i,j) \in G$ at time $t$ by $s_t(i,j) \in \{0,1\}$. We mark the shape on the grid at time $t$ using the status of all cells $(i,j) \in G$ as $s_t(i,j) = 1$ if $(i,j) \in S(x_t)$ and $s_t(i,j) = 0$ if $(i,j) \not\in S(x_t)$. I have illustrated this in image 1.
1: 
Consider that at each time $t$, the parameter $x_t$ takes values randomly (or using an update equation from $x_{t-1}$ to $x_t$) from $x \in$ {$1,\dots, n$}. Then, we receive a one-hot encoded observation $o_t$ which is consistent with the current shape $S(x_t)$, i.e., the cell which takes a value of $1$ in $o_t$ is a cell which also takes a value of $1$ in $S(x_t)$. I have illustrated the feasible observations for a given shape in image 2.
2: 
Goal: I want to train a neural network using the sequence of data $(x_t, o_t)$ for $t=0, 1, \dots$ to learn a stationary mapping from each parameter $x \in$ {$1, \dots, n$} to the corresponding shape $S(x)$.
So far, I have trained a neural network to learn such a mapping from each parameter to its corresponding shape ""offline,"" as follows: I pre-processed the observation data to merge the observations corresponding to each parameter $x \in$ {$1, \dots, n$} so that effectively I am training with the knowledge of the entire shape at each time $t$ using the data point $(x_t, S(x_t))$. In this case, I used a differentiable approximation of the Hausdorff metric and dice loss to define the loss function of my neural network. This is an idea from image segmentation: Reducing the Hausdorff Distance in Medical Image Segmentation with Convolutional Neural Networks.
However, I am confused about how I can achieve this task in an ""online"" setting, where I want to learn the mapping from parameters to shapes using only sampled observation data. Let's denote the  neural network's predicted shape at any time $t$ for a parameter $x \in$ {$1, \dots, N$} by $S^p_t(x)$. Note that the predicted shape $S^p_t(x)$ is likely a ""soft"" shape, i.e., each cell $(i,j)$ of the grid $G$ has a continuous predicted status $s^p_t(i,j) \in [0,1]$.
So far, I have the following ideas to achieve this task:

Consider a window of $N \in \mathbb{N}$ time steps starting at some time $\bar{t}$ with a data sequence $((x_{\bar{t}}, o_{\bar{t}}), \dots, x_{\bar{t} + N}, o_{\bar{t} + N}) )$. For all $t = \bar{t}, \dots, \bar{t}+N$, we fix the neural network's output to a shape $S^p_{\bar{t}}(x_t)$. Then, we use a similar approximation of the Hausdorff distance $d_H(\cdot, \cdot)$ directly on the observations and average it across time, to get the loss $\dfrac{\sum_{t = \bar{t}}^{\bar{t}+N} d_H \big(S^p_\bar{t}(x_t), o_t \big)}N$. Then, backpropagate to train the neural network once with respect to this loss, move on to time $t=N+1$ and repeat this process.

Consider the same approach as the first idea but with an approximate Chamfer distance $d_C(\cdot, \cdot)$ to define the loss function instead of the approximate Hausdorff distance. Here, we would have to approximate the Chamfer distance to work with the soft prediction of the neural network and I am as of yet unsure about how to do this.

Consider an RNN, like an LSTM, instead of a regular neural network in either the first or second ideas. This may allow the neural network to track a representation of ""history of observations"" and learn to better predict the underlying set from observation data.


Request: I would really appreciate any and all help towards figuring out how to achieve this goal!
Are there any standard techniques or approaches to such problems that I am missing?
I do not have a complete background in such problems and am still learning. For example, I know that a KL Divergence based loss can be used to learn a probability distribution from sampled points. Is there a similar idea that I can use to learn a shape or set from sampled points?
Are there other ways to look at this problem which make it easier to solve?
Thank you for taking the time to read my very long question and many thoughts!

In RLHF, the reward function is a neural network. This means we can compute its gradients cheaply and accurately through backpropagation. Now, we want to find a policy that maximizes reward (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155). Then, why do we need PPO to find that policy? Since the reward function is differentiable and cheap to evaluate, wouldn't some gradient descent algorithm such as SGD or Adam be enough?

Why use Deep Learning instead of algorithms for decision making in self-driving cars?,"
Let's say I want to build a self-driving car that uses cameras and ai to detect objects and driving lanes.
So if the camera detects e.g. a car in front, it calculates the distance (using a sensor) and passes that information to the algorithm which handles steering and acceleration.
Another example is parking. I could just write an algorithm that can park the car perfectly every time, instead of trying to train an ai, which would take a lot of time and computation.
Why would I use Deep Learning to make the car navigate instead of using a simple algorithm (like in video games) that can find the best path and steer accordingly?

Can action be dominated by state features in actor-critic algorithms?,"
I have a case where my state consists of relatively large number of features, e.g. 50, whereas my action size is 1. I wonder whether my state features dominate the action in my critic network. I believe in theory eventually it shouldn't matter but considering the sequential nature of RL training I am afraid the state features outweigh the action and its effect will be negligible.
What I already tried is the following:

Here where the state output and action are combined I use tanh activation because my action is in [-1, 1]. This led to almost flat performance from the very beginning with no improvement at all. I understand this might be due to vanishing gradients caused by tanh. I also tried the linear activation instead of the tanh, this time average episode return was fluctuating around some value with no signs of learning.
What I am currently testing is stacking the action, say 50 times, to match the number of the state features.
Any other ideas on how to tackle this issue.

Open-source vocal cloning (speech-to-speech neural style transfer),"
I want to program and train a voice cloner, in part to learn about this area of AI, and in part to use as a prototype of audio for testing and getting feedback from early adopters before recording in a studio with voice actors. For the prototype, I have a set of recordings from voice actors. I would like to record my voice, in English or other languages, then run a neural network and produce an audio with the same text, intonation and emotion but with roughly the actors' voices. It doesn't need to be perfect; 80% right and believable would be enough to get good feedback and reach a final version of the script before recording. I have 30 minutes to one hour of utterances from each voice I want to clone.
The closest I have found is Resemble.ai, which has an impressive video, but the public plan is only in English and other languages are prohibitively expensive. The engineer published a masters' thesis as an open-source project, but this project does only text-to-speech, not speech-to-speech. Another startup is play.ht, but again it seems to be English-only.
This open source project seems to do what I want, cloning Kate Winslet's voice, but it has no installation instructions and so I haven't tried yet.
Can you recommend an open-source project, ideally in Python and Tensorflow, to roughly replace a voice with another?
Note: This question is similar to What is the State-of-the-Art open source Voice Cloning tool right now? , except that that question is old and the project mentioned only does text-to-speech, not speech-to-speech.

On prompt, when asked:
Q: Which order took the longest time to process and why?
A: Order with Id 2 took 5 days, probably it took this time due its number of products: 20.

Is data useless for a neural network if some inputs are derivatives of other inputs?,"
That is, if some of the inputs to a neural network can be calculated by a pre-determined function whose variables are other inputs, then are those specific inputs useless?
For example, suppose there are three inputs, $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$. If $x_3$ is determined by function $x_3=f(x_1,x_2)$, then will $x_3$ be useless for training a neural network?
","['neural-networks', 'training', 'datasets', 'input-layer']","No it is not useless.The relationship may not be obvious, and having the data will allow the network to learn this 𝑓 relationship.Further, even if 𝑓 is obvious, networks are so sample inefficient that more (non-noisy) data is always helpful. In fact, the common practice is to train for hundreds of epochs on the same exact samples - because we can not learn quickly enough from seeing them only once.That said, there are some cases where data is harmful. For example, if we have an imbalanced dataset, adding more samples to exacerbate that imbalanced may be a bad idea.But in general, this added data will still be of use."
How to expand an agent's action space with more actions?,"

Additional actions would also be included later on, such as moving left, and right.
PPO has a check for matching action spaces, so just providing a new environment to the model doesn't work.

How can I expand the action space so that the PPO model doesn't reject the new agent?

"How does ""noises"" in computing convolution affect the model precision and the training speed?","
Consider the discrete convolution written in a matrix form, if a small amount $s$ of the zero entries (represented as white blocks) are deviated from zero, can the model precision or the training speed be increased? A ""small"" amount means, for example, $s \leq n$, where $n$ is the dimension of the matrix.

I guess this idea is similar to an inverse procedure of dropout/dilution, where a small amount of matrix entries are replaced by zero. Here, a small amount of zeros are replaced by some nonzero random values.

As a newbie to AI, I am not familiar with many historic papers on the development of AI. Probably some researchers have already analyzed this several years ago.

My question: What if one class we need to detect has very few appearances and the only appearances of this class are on the images where other classes are visible too? Because this means that if we add more data with the examples of undersampled class we are automatically increasing imbalance because on these pictures there are objects of the abundant classes that we also have to label.
Is it possible to maybe manually cover (in proverbial ""paint"") appearances of the classes we have a lot of samples of? Maybe YOLO doesn't have big problem with unbalance?

References for the theory of pretraining and unsupervised learning to improve subsequent supervised learning,"
I am not sure if the title of this post uses the correct terminology, so suggestions are welcome.
I have been following a lot of the ideas of using Pre-training methods on neural networks, to improve the accurancy of those networks on subsequent tasks. For example, the Word2Vec paper and others in that same line developed the idea of pretraining word embeddings, as a way to improve subsequent tasks like text translation. Transformer networks themselves being with converting raw data through content and positional embedding layers.
There are other examples of this idea as well. Chris Re at Stanford has explored the idea of ""weak supervision"" where a neural network is trained on a set of weak or noisy labels--that are cheap to obtain. After training on the weak labels, the network is trained on some higher quality labeled data to gain greater accuracy.
In images, this approach has had a little less success, but still attempted. There has been work on trying to pretrain a neural network on in-painting sections of an image. Once the network is pre-trained, then ML engineers will use that model to try and generate new images, or to improve performance on image segmentation tasks.
So in each of these cases, the model is trained on one task as a way to embed domain knowledge into the network for subsequent tasks. However, I have never really read an
explicit explanation or elaboration on this theory. I was wondering if anyone knew of
a good reference--paper, article, book, etc.--that discusses this theory and its approaches, limitation, etc.

"Is the ""Chinese room"" an explanation of how ChatGPT works?","
Sorry if this question makes no sense. I'm a software developer but know very little about AI.
Quite a while ago, I read about the Chinese room, and the person inside who has had a lot of training/instructions how to combine symbols, and, as a result, is very good at combining symbols in a ""correct"" way, for whatever definition of correct. I said ""training/instructions"" because, for the purpose of this question, it doesn't really make a difference if the ""knowledge"" was acquired by parsing many many examples and getting a ""feeling"" for what's right and what's wrong (AI/learning), or by a very detailed set of instructions (algorithmic).
So, the person responds with perfectly reasonable sentences, without ever understanding Chinese, or the content of its input.
Now, as far as I understand ChatGPT (and I might be completely wrong here), that's exactly what ChatGPT does. It has been trained on a huge corpus of text, and thus has a very good feeling which words go together well and which don't, and, given a sentence, what's the most likely continuation of this sentence. But that doesn't really mean it understands the content of the sentence, it only knows how to chose words based on what it has seen. And because it doesn't really understand any content, it mostly gives answers that are correct, but sometimes it's completely off because it ""doesn't really understand Chinese"" and doesn't know what it's talking about.
So, my question: is this ""juggling of Chinese symbols without understanding their meaning"" an adequate explanation of how ChatGPT works, and if not, where's the difference? And if yes, how far is AI from models that can actually understand (for some definition of ""understand"") textual content?
","['agi', 'philosophy', 'natural-language-understanding', 'chatgpt', 'chinese-room-argument']","Yes, the Chinese Room argument by John Searle essentially demonstrates that at the very least it is hard to locate intelligence in a system based on its inputs and outputs. And the ChatGPT system is built very much as a machine for manipulating symbols according to opaque rules, without any grounding provided for what those symbols mean.The large language models are trained without ever getting to see, touch, or get any experience reference for any of their language components, other than yet more written language. It is much like trying to learn the meaning of a word by looking up its dictionary definition and finding that composed of other words that you don't know the meaning of, recursively without any way of resolving it. If you possessed such a dictionary and no knowledge of the words defined, you would still be able to repeat those definitions, and if they were received by someone who did understand some of the words, the result would look like reasoning and ""understanding"". But this understanding is not yours, you are simply able to retrieve it on demand from where someone else stored it.This is also related to the symbol grounding problem in cognitive science.It is possible to argue that pragmatically the ""intelligence"" shown by the overall system is still real and resides somehow in the rules of how to manipulate the symbols. This argument and other similar ones try to side-step or dismiss some proposed hard problems in AI - for instance, by focusing on behaviour of the whole system and not trying to address the currently impossible task of asking whether any system has subjective experience. This is beyond the scope of this answer (and not really what the question is about), but it is worth noting that The Chinese Room argument has some criticism, and is not the only way to think about issues with AI systems based on language and symbols.I would agree with you that the latest language models, and ChatGPT are good example models of the The Chinese Room made real. The room part that is, there is no pretend human in the middle, but actually that's not hugely important - the role of the human in the Chinese room is to demonstrate that from the perspective of an entity inside the room processing a database of rules, nothing need to possess any understanding or subjective experience that is relevant to the text.

While error < min_error

Forward pass

Back propagation
Update weights

But when we get out of the loop because the error is small enaugh, if we save the neural network as it is, we are saving something that we have not tested yet. Wouldn't it be better to keep the previous weight values, as those are the ones for which we know the error?

Many To One LSTM - Can I Use the Same Sequence as Input from Previous Timesteps?,"
I'm new to LSTMs, and I'm trying to do a basic timeseries prediction using stock prices. However, I'm a bit confused as to how the LSTM is supposed to remember outputs from previous timesteps when it has a many to one shape.
For example, let's say we're at timestep n, and the following timeseries is part of my input:
[[100, 10], [300, 30], [200, 20]]

And it maps to some output, let's say 1
Great. But let's say at timestep n - 1, when the input was just [[100, 10], [300, 30]], the output was 0. How will the LSTM know this?
Should I include the same data at different timesteps (using something like zero padding) with the corresponding output? Or am I totally misunderstanding something about how LSTMs work?

How to structure the input data for non-vision deep reinforcement learning?,"
I am currently designing a custom gym environment that is based on sensor data and I struggle a bit with structuring the data and designing the model. Virtually every resource I find online is kind of vision based, in the sense that it takes images as input arrays.
Data structure
For each time step, I get a couple of readings from each sensor. This would be an example reading from one sensor, with ... representing other variables.
{
  ""temperature"":""20.3"",
  ""humidity"":""63"",
  ...
}

Now I see two approaches how to structure the input array for a model (t being temperature, h being humidity):
[
 [t,h,...],
 [t,h,...],
]

[
 [t,t,...],
 [h,h,...],
]

Note that this represents the data for one time-step and is not representing a series of time-steps.
Question
Does it make a difference how I structure that data?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'deep-rl']","Does it make a difference how I structure that data?Since your gym environment creates two values, t and h at one single step, I believe the way you structure your input matters.Let's start with this one:If I understand correctly, the index of the list is the input at the i-th step, so your input at step 0 is inputs = X[0] = [t,h,...]. This is the correct way. Your model sees t and h at the same time, which is what your environment produces.If you structure your input in the second way:This way, it means your model sees t first, then sees h in the next step. This is technically incorrect from what we assume, since each input should be independent of each other. What's worse, I see that your t and h are on different scales, so it is highly possible that the training will diverge.However, depending on the difficulty of the task (which we don't know), you might or might not see a big difference between two structures. However, I recommend sticking with the first one."

When you ask it to recite something like The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock, it can do so very accurately... yet, it does not have a copy of Prufrock ""memorized"" somewhere.

Latent Diffusion Model Can't Learn the Latent Space of a VAE for the MNIST-Fashion Dataset,"
I'm currently playing around with LDMs on the MNIST-Fashion dataset. I thought the VQVAEs used in the original paper were a bit overkill for what I'm doing (and I don't fully understand how they construct the discretized codebook latent space), so I went with a simple convolutional autoencoder with a kl-regularizer to map to an approximately gaussian latent space. I've run this model a few times and verified that it does reconstruct the original image inputs fairly well.
I run into issues when I try to use this model with my LDM implementation. I first made sure standard diffusion directly in image space works, which it does. I then tried latent diffusion with my trained autoencoder and I can't get the loss to drop below a certain threshold (~1.0), and the image outputs are pretty much gaussian noise still.
As stated in the paper, I sample latent vectors from the encoder part of the autoencoder and scale them with stats collected from the first batch of data like so:
                    batch = autoencoder.encode(batch).sample().detach()
                    # rescale the embeddings to be unit variance
                    if epoch == 0 and step == 0:
                        print(""Calculating scale factor..."")
                        std = batch.flatten().std()
                        scale_factor = 1. / std
                        cfg.scale_factor = scale_factor.item()
                    batch *= scale_factor

And then pretty much everything else (applying noise, calculating loss, etc) is the same as standard diffusion. Am I missing something, or is the latent space of my simple conv-autoencoder hard to learn for some reason? I would think that, since an autoencoder is just a deterministic mapping from image space to a lower dimensional one, that the LDM should be able to learn the latter just fine, or is there something inherent in the original paper's transformer architectures for the encoder / codebook latent space that is important to learning for the LDM?

How to prevent machine learning to learn misleading correlations,"
I am currently training a Random Forest model on about 400 features per instance. The training ROC was about 0.95 which is pretty high I think. However, when visualizing the variable importance of the Random Forest model, I found that the most important features for the models are the availability flags.
That is, since I have some kind of irregular data, I aggregated data with statistical values such as mean, median, and so on. To note whether these values could be calculated in the last observation window, I added a binary flag. That is, if the flag is true, the statistical values are calculated, if the flag is false, the missing values were replaced with 0. Now these flags have a high variable importance, which means that there is some correlation that for class 1 the data is more likely to be present than for class 0.
However, this is not what the model is basing its prediction on, as it is just a percularity of the underlying data collection process. How do you normally deal with this?

How to evaluate output of text generation models?,"
Evaluation of a wide variety of natural language generation (NLG) tasks is difficult. For instance, for a question answering model, it is hard for a human to quantify how well the model has answered a particular question. Doing this at scale is even harder, because it requires automating that judgement about output quality.
The most common approach for evaluation of NLG at scale involves building a set of test queries and reference answers, where the reference answers set out the 'gold standard' for how the model should respond. In the case of a Q&A bot, this would be a list of questions and 'good' answers; for a machine translation system, this would be some human-verified translations.
A good text generation model ideally takes a query as input and returns an output as close as possible to the reference given in the test set. As such, the model is assessed by passing in each query in turn, and comparing how semantically similar the model's output is to the reference output. If the model's output is similar to the reference, then this means the model is performing well.
My question is how do we assess semantic similarity between the reference and candidate answers?
A few ideas:

Old-school string matching - Calculate word, subword, or n-gram overlap between candidate and reference answers. Can use metrics like F1-score or recall depending on use case. The idea is that a good answers includes as much of the surface content from the reference as possible, with as little extraneous information as possible. However, this sort of approach performs poorly where the meaning of the answer is the same, but the surface form is different - or vice versa, e.g. 'The cat is under the mat' and 'The mat is under the cat' have a different meaning but contain all the same unigrams, so would get a high similarity score with a string-based metric.
Vector distance between embeddings - Use text embeddings trained to map paraphrases to similar embeddings. Encode the reference and candidate answers, and then use a measure of vector distance (e.g. cosine-similarity) to evaluate. If - once encoded - the reference and candidate answers are 'close' then the two answers should be a near-paraphrase of one another. This means the candidate answer does a good job of including the meaning from the reference answer. However, this method is only as good as the embeddings underpinning it. Moreover, it seems circular to use semantic similarity to evaluate the outputs of tasks where semantic similarity is used to produce the outputs (as is typically the case for Q&A bots, semantic search, summarisation, machine translation, etc.)
Mover distance in semantic space* - This is a similar approach to using vector distance. The idea is that encoded text can be visualised as $n$ points in $k$-dimensional space, where $n$ is the number of tokens in the text and $k$ is the dimension of the embeddings used. Then, we can think about the candidate and reference answers being $n_c$ and $n_r$ points in that semantic space. We can then think about moving candidate points to sit on top of reference points - the total distance involved in this movement is the 'mover distance'. There exists some optimal, i.e. most efficient, way of moving candidate points to sit on top of reference points, and this gives the 'mover score' for that model on that query.

What approaches have I missed? What are the strengths and weaknesses of each approach? Are there some state-of-the-art approaches that outperform these?

,{ x:500, y:100, text: ""197"" }
,{ x:10, y:120, text: ""Label 2"" }
...
]

This example has perfect coordinates which would make it easier. Real data unfortunately does not. For example the X for 2021 could be 200 and the value 270, but for 2020 it could be 490 & 510. The X is based on the text size and with centered text, longer text has a lower X. I could calculate the center of each word, but even that is a little skewed.
The end result of our tool would be that we know the value for each label and year.

Label 1 value for 2020 = 197

I tried combining the entire page as a single text and then using spaCy to extract data, but it will generate documents based on each line and disregarding column.
I also tried using Tabula to generate the data to a more clear table, but because of the skewing the rows/columns don't always match. ""2021"" could be column B and the values in column C.
I also tried reversing it the whole process to match if a line is a certain label. I would train the network on a sentence like A long Label with multiple words 90 120 with class Long label and then be able to pass in any line to find if it is in fact a Long label and then proceed to get the two values. I got decent results in a first attempt, but again there is no way to know if ""90"" or ""120"" belongs to ""2021"".

Does object detection for single-class images have any advantages over classification?,"
I recently joined a new project, and saw that they are using object detection instead of image classification for one of the business cases. The images can only belong to one class (example, the image is either a cat or something else) and the location of the object does not matter. They just want to detect the presence of it. The training/test data have bounding boxes drawn over the objects, and I am trying to find evidence, if any, as to why this method has any advantages over normal classification. My initial though was that with bounding boxes, provided they are accurately drawn, the model can learn key features better than usual classification, since in classification it is learning the entire image, but I am not sure, because in that case, then most classification problems would have bounding boxes drawn over the key object to improve results.
Are there any advantages of the current approach or is classification the 'right' option?
","['machine-learning', 'deep-learning', 'classification', 'object-detection']","I think you are right, having bboxes help the model localize objects much better, and usually, the classification comes with each bbox it found so the space now will be reduced to fit just one important object that it is trying to make a prediction, not the entire image where there are a lot of objects.Classification is only good if your input has information controlled, or else it can cause confusion for the model as the input may not have a single label for the whole image."

","['reinforcement-learning', 'board-games']","You don't have ""9 possible states"" in your problem, you have those 9 board squares multiplied by all possible values that the numbers within them can take, in all combinations. If those are discrete integers within bounds, then your space is finite - as an example if each square could contain the number $1$,$2$ or $3$ then your state space would have size $3^9 \times 9 = 177147$ (the extra $\times 9$ is because you also need to track which square the agent is in, and that can occur in any combination with the square values). If instead the ranges are unbound, or numbers real-valued, then your state space is infinite.It is still possible to solve RL problems with infinite state space. As your action space is simple and discrete, you can still use value-based methods.The step you need to make is to look into approximation schemes.

I am trying to train a model on sequential data [shape:((435802, 20), (435802,))]
where every sequence is of length 20 and  $$X,Y \in [0,6]$$
Concept: each value in the sequence represents a class of real data instance and the objective is to predict the next class instance.

X[n] = [3, 4, 3, 0, 2, 6, 6, 6, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 2, 2, 4, 2, 0, 0] => Y[n] = 0

Class Distribution in Y:
0: 46458
1: 40909
2: 76398
3: 102515
4: 80830
5: 43569
6: 45123

I have tried various combinations of layers like Conv, LSTM, SimpleRNN, Bidirectional, GRU, Dense, etc

Which deep learning models are suitable for network_parameters-to-images mapping?,"
I face the problem of learning a mapping (or a translation) $f: (x,\theta) \to x^\prime$, where $x, x^\prime$ are images, $\theta$ is the parameters of a neural network.
I know the models for parameters-to-parameters mapping (meta-learning), images-to-images mapping (style transfer, auto-encoders). But I have no idea which deep learning models can do parameters-to-images mapping.
Any suggestion is welcomed.

Graph recognition with machine learning?,"
Let's say we have drawing of graphs (in the graph theory sense).
Is it possible to use machine learning to convert such drawing into a format that is understandable by computers, such as a list of edges like ((e,a), (e,f), ...., (g,n)).
I did some search but haven't seen anything like this.
If you have experience in image recognition,
do you think this is a feasible approach?

How to ensure continuity of AI model logic?,"
I am aware that this question might be vague but I must try anyways.
I am looking for a method or an algorithm or even just some keywords (to conduct further research) of how to deal with phenomenon of making sure that model logic will be correctly tracking changes in analysed camera feed based on CV models' results that are not always 100% correct and there might be some other minor disruptions to the image.
It will be easiest to explain with the example: I have an app that will analyse camera feed of a parking situation in online mode to have the best possible view of the situation what cars are in and where, which of them left and when, which came in to what spot etc.
I plan to use series of computer vision models such as object detection, CNN for detected objects classification, some OCR and so on. But the problem with this approach is that each model even if trained very well sooner or later will run into some problems like an object that was recognised one frame before is not recognised in current frame or OCR will confuse ""5"" and ""S"" and the resulting string will not be the same so the model can assume there is different car in the same place on one frame.
Even though these errors will appear for example at 0.5% frames, this will still confuse the logic of the model a lot, if the logic will assume that the detection/classification results are always correct and disregard potential models' mistakes.
Another example can be something that will cover part of the camera view for a quick moment and that will result in misdetection some of the objects on few more frames. So ideally the remedy to that problem should have some sort of memory and validation mechanism that will compare older and newer frames whether change in detected objects was legit or it came back to previous state after some short period of time.
Is there any theory or methodology or just some good practices of dealing with such issues or it has to be analysed and mitigated on individual basis?

How to estimate the gradient of an argmin loss,"
Suppose we have a neural network $f_\theta(x)$, where $x$ is the input and $\theta$ is the network's parameters.
For each $\theta$, we can minimize $f_\theta(x)$ w.r.t. $x$ and obtain the minimum point $x^*(\theta):=\arg\min_x f_\theta(x)$.
My question is: how to estimate the gradient: $\frac{d x^*(\theta)}{d \theta}$ ?
I did some surveys and found this gradient (in fact any gradient) can be estimated by the finite difference technique. However, it is rather slow when $\theta$ includes many parameters, e.g., $f_\theta$ is a large neural network.
Any possible approach is welcomed.

And finally here is my Matlab code:

delta=1e6;
alpha=0.1;

while (delta > thrs)

    for i=1:9 % we have 9 (s, r, s') cases
        if i==1
            v_pr(1)=v(1)+alpha*[0+1*v(2)-v(1)];
            Delta(1)=abs(v_pr(1)-v(1));
        elseif i==2

            Delta(2)=abs(v_pr(2)-v(2));
        elseif (i>=3) && (i<=8)
            v_pr(2)=v(2)+alpha*[1+1*v_ter-v(2)];

MCTS players keep replaying identical games,"
I am currently training a self-playing Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search (MCTS) algorithm with a neural network prior, and it seems to be working pretty well.
However one problem I have is when I compare my new iteration of the player against the previous version to see whether the new one is an improvement over the previous one.
Ideally I want to compare the two players to play 20 games of Tic Tac Toe with each being the first player in 10 of them. But what ends up happening is that each of those 10 games play out identically (because the MCTS in each player is reset at the beginning of each game, and since they are playing to win, they both take the play with highest probability, rather than randomly drawing actions based on the probabilities, so each player is making exactly the same decisions as they did in the previous game).
So I understand why this isn't working, however I'm not sure what people commonly do to fix this problem?
I could choose to not reset the MCTS between each game?, but that also feels like a weird fix, since the players are then still learning as the games are played, and game 10 would be quite different from game 1, but maybe that is just how people normally do this?

Why does $\alpha=1$ mean batch MC Learning?,"
Here is a part of slide 4 from the link:
https://tao.lri.fr/tiki-download_wiki_attachment.php?attId=1683

Why does $\alpha=1$ mean batch MC Learning? I do not see this clearly when I compare with averaging returns formula.
",['reinforcement-learning'],"I did not read the link but I am giving a standard derivation as it can be found in Sutton-Barto for instance.The average return formula can be reformulated:
\begin{align}
V_{n+1}(s) &= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}R_{i} \\
           &= \frac{1}{n}\left(R_{n} +\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}R_{i}   \right) \\
           &= \frac{1}{n}\left(R_{n} +(n-1) \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}R_{i}   \right) \\
           &= \frac{1}{n}\left(R_{n} + (n-1) V_{n}(s) \right) \\
           &= \frac{1}{n}\left(R_{n} + nV_{n}(s) - V_{n}(s) \right) \\
           &= V_{n}(s) + \frac{1}{n} (R_{n} - V_{n}(s))
\end{align}
where $V_{n}$ is the estimate of the value function after $n-1$ averages over the return of the state $s$. We can interpret each $i$ as a single visit to $s$ or as a batch of visits of $s$ in which case $R_{i}$ would be the averaged return of this batch. Setting $\frac{1}{n} = \alpha$ directly results in the formula for incremental updates. Note that if we set $n = \alpha = 1$ we just set the value function of the state to the return of the first episode or the average of the first batch $V(s) = R_{1}$."
Why is cross entropy loss averaged and not used directly as a sum during model training?,"

Can Q-learning and other RL algorithms solve CNF SAT?,"
I encountered a question about solving CNF SAT using reinforcement learning: A state is a partial substitution to the variables, and each action is choosing an empty variable and set its value (to True or False). If the formula is satisfied the reward is 2, and if it's not, the reward is 0. The discount factor is $\gamma \in (0, 1)$
Does Q-Learning can solve the problem and converge to an optimal plan for any CNF formula? and what about other RL algorithms?
I think it will converge, but I am not sure if I am right.

How does the cross entropy loss function interact with the final layer of a neural network?,"
I am having trouble understanding how the result of categorical cross entropy loss can be used to calculate the gradient for all of the weights.
The output of cross entropy function is the sum of all of the negative log likelihoods multiplied by the one-hot encoded vector of the actual(desired) result of the neural net. Once I get this information I do not understand what I am supposed to do with it.
To calculate the gradient of cross entropy loss, many sources on the internet have told me to use this formula:
//The variable actualOutput being the one-hot encoded vector of desired outputs based on input
for(int i = 0; i < softmaxOutput.size(); i++)
{
   softmaxOutput[i] -= actualOutput[i];
}

Then to take this result and pipe it in to the softmax derivative function. I was very confused by this, because it does not involve the result of the loss function at all during backward propagation. Even worse of a problem for me is that when I implement this it does not work. Am I looking at this problem the right way?
Here is some of my code for the entropy loss formula I am using made specifically to solve MNIST:

How (if possible at all) the rewards (from the reinforcement learning) can be used to generate the data for the supervised learning?,"
How (if possible at all) rewards (from reinforcement learning) can be used to generate data for supervised learning? This is very topical question, because human feedback usually comes in the form or single-number rating, but this rating should be used on the updating the models that were trained using supervised learning (even masked data approach).
I am just starting to explore this topic and I have found so far the entering points into this realm:

answer to my previous question Can supervised learning be recast as reinforcement learning problem? pointed towards negative answer to this question, but the article is certainly outdated;
article https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-chatgpt-actually-works/ about RL from human feedback (RLHF) may give some clues
https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02875 is topical article that can bring the exact answer to my question and I am starting to read it (possibly I will write answer based on it, if there won't be any aswers)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZNyHoXgV7M is good video that uses reward-based data augmentation to supervised learning and it initially promised to show connection between supervised and reinforcement learning, but it remained at that - reward-based augmentation. Though the KL divergences (direct and inverted) can be promising for build such conversion among both approaches.

I just have sense that this should be possible and that I am not aware of some important trend.

How can I find an upper bound on the number of iterations required to have less than $\varepsilon$ difference in the value of state?,"
I learned about the Value Iteration algorithm which can help find an optimal policy and values of an MDP with state rewards:
$$V_0(s)=R(s)$$
$$V_{t}(s)=R(s)+\gamma\cdot\underset{a}{max}\underset{s'}{\sum}T(s, a, s')\cdot V_{t-1}(s')$$
How can I find an upper bound on the number of iterations required to have less than $\varepsilon$ difference in the value of state $s$ (i.e $|V_t(s)-V_{t-1}(s)|\le\varepsilon$)?
For example, suppose I have an MDP with 10 states, where in each state there are 2 actions and each action can lead to 3 states. The reward of each state is between 0 and 5, $\gamma=0.9$ and $\varepsilon=0.1$.
How can I find an upper bound for the number of iterations? I tried to solve the equations $0.9^t=0.1$, but this is not the right way to do it.

Progressive GAN breaks at higher resolution because of batch size?,"
I'm trying to reproduce the paper of progressive GANs, by following a tutorial available on github.
All is well up until a resolution of 64:

Then at the resolution of 128 all is going downhill pretty quickly:


Since at lower resolutions all seems to be working fine it seems like my network architecture is correct.
The only thing I can think of is that because of my single GPU memory constraints my batch sizes are too small. Between 64x64 and 128x128 I had to reduce my batch size from 32 to 6. (I have an RTX 3060 with 6GB.) This has impact on the minibatch std dev which is added as a channel in the last block of the network, but that's unlikely the cause.
Probably the instability is caused by too small batch sizes which makes the gradients 'too stochastic' for the optimizer. Small batch sizes don't work well when using batch normalization at each convolution layer.
How can I reproduce this paper on my simple single GPU laptop?
I could try to make larger batches by running minibatches through and accumulating the gradients before performing a step, but then I wouldn't be able to get accurate statistics for the minibatch std dev. I'm not sure how important that is.
I want to reproduce this paper, so that I can compare my ideas for improvements against a baseline.
Should I just give up on higher resolutions (since they would only be achievable on multi-GPU machines), or should I adjust my implementation to see if I can achieve higher resolution?

Non-deterministic play in reinforcement learning,"
I'm training a reinforcement learning agent on simple two-player games (I'm doing Q-learning). I noticed that for a given state the value of each action is usually different. Thus, the greedy policy leads to a deterministic agent. Sometimes it may be useful to add randomness to the agent's policy.
First, this makes for more interesting games when playing against a human. Second, if I want to test how strong the agent is or compare two agents, performing multiple tests appears to be helpful (but only if each test could potentially lead to a different outcome). Does this make sense?
Is there some standard approach to add some randomness to the agent's behavior? I tried replacing greedy with softmax but this appears to decrease the agent's performance a lot.

SCINet: how does interactive learning work?,"
i'm having some trouble understanding how does the basic building block of a SCINet works. In the paper the author describes the SCI-block with the following figure:

In which $\phi$, $\theta$, $\eta$ and $\rho$ are convolutional filters with the following architecture:

All this is described with the equations below:

What I understood is that the splitted sequences go through a gated linear unit (GLU) in order to control what information is passed from the complementary sequence. This creates $F_{odd}^{s}$ and $F_{even}^{s}$ which now contain relevant features from their complementary sequence.
However, I can't seem to understand why these enhanced sequences are further projected onto two additional hidden states with filters $\rho$ and $\eta$ in order to substract or add them to their complementary sequence. Why is this step added?
If this is a common practice in neural networks i'd be glad to know it's name and if you could point me to some reference that would be great. Thanks in advance!

What happens if one uses non-valid kernels in regression?,"
When introducing kernelization in regression, it is emphasized that a kernel function $k(x_i, x_j)$ has to represent a scalar product in some high dimensional feature space, $k(x_i, x_j) = \phi(x_i)^T \phi(x_j)$. Consequently, a kernel function has to be symmetric and positive semidefinite.
Thus, not all functions can be used as kernels. However, in the end the estimator $\hat{y}$  ends up being just a linear combination of the kernel function evaluated at the data points: $\hat{y}(x) = \sum_i \alpha_i k(x_i, x)$. It's like expressing/approximating $y$ in the basis $\varphi_i(x) = k(x_i, x)$. The choice of basis is then entirely up to me given that some basis will give better approximations than others.
How could I then reconcile the two points of view?

A kernel represents a scalar product in some high dimensional feature space thus has to obey the corresponding restrictions (positive semidefinite and symmetric)

A kernel is simply a basis function for my approximation thus it can be any function with no restrictions


What would happen in practice if someone tried to use non-valid kernels? Would it lead to some pathological behavior or simply a poor approximation?

Why FCNN is not always better than CNN?,"
Why Fully-Connected Neural Network is not always better than Convolutional Neural Network?
FCNN is easily overfitting due to many params, then why didn't it reduce the params to reduce overfitting.
If eventually CNN will be flattened into FCNN, that's mean 2D layers (Conv2D, MaxPool, etc) of CNN is basically just 1D layers vector.
Also CNN is not fully connected when doing convolution, except the kernel size is 1×1 with stride 1 which basically same as fully connected layer. We know that fully connected means better.
And I think kernel size 1×1 and stride 1 in CNN (which basically equal same as FCNN) is performing better even though overfitting.
","['neural-networks', 'convolutional-neural-networks', 'fully-convolutional-networks']","Why Fully-Connected Neural Network is not always better than Convolutional Neural Network?The main reason why in many cases, a CNN will outperform a fully-connected (FC) neural network, i.e. MLP, is grounded in symmetry. For example, a CNN responds very naturally to image translations. This behavior is called translational equivariance which arises from shifting the same weights (i.e. the convolutional kernel) over the space of an image. The result is a model that - when trained on images where an object is in the center - will generalize to images where an object is off-center. This happens even though such images are not in your training set. An MLP cannot do this, it would have be trained on a dataset containing the objects in all possible positions in order to generalize nicely.
As a side note: Some architectures like the transformer use FC layers in the style of a convolution as well, because the exact same weights are applied to all input tokens individually. So a model doesn't have to be your typical 2D-ConvNet to be a type of CNN.FCNN is easily overfitting due to many params, then why didn't it reduce the params to reduce overfitting.The model does not 'know' that it is overfitting because all it ever sees in training is the training dataset and an overfitted model performs great on this data. Another way to look at this is to view backpropagation as finding the path of least resistance to the optimal model. In many cases (especially with large models for small datasets) it is easier for the model to memorize the training samples instead of finding a very general solution.We know that fully connected means better.All layers have benefits and drawbacks, you can't really call any layer generally better, a fully-connected layer can do some things better than a CNN and other things (e.g. images) not so much.And I think kernel size 1×1 and stride 1 in CNN (which basically equal same as FCNN) is performing better even though overfitting.An overfitted model might look nice in training, but as soon as you show the model novel samples, these are much more likely going to be misclassified. Especially messy real-world data will likely result in bad model performance when you actually want to use such a model."

This might be a stupid question, and I might have read too much about neural networks and CNNs today so my mind is a bit of a mess. But I get that neural networks contains neurons or nodes. They calculate a dot product and sends the output further into the network.
But what about CNNs? The initial convolution layer will use a kernel convolution to go over the binary pixel data and calculate a dot product based on the weights in the kernel / filter, and the numbers from the binary pixel data.
And after this we get a feature map, we can have several feature maps that find certain features or patterns, and we can pool and use other functions further on in the network to achieve certain predictions.
But where are the neurons in the CNN? Aren't there ""just"" convolutional, pooling, flattened layers, and a final fully connected network?
",['convolutional-neural-networks'],"There are no stupid questions :)As @MuhammadIkhwanPerwira pointed out, the pixels themselves can be thought of as ""neurons"". His answer to your follow-up question is also valid: generally yes the pixels in the feature map can be thought of similarly to the neurons in the hidden layers of a fully-connected layer, but this analogy starts to break down a bit when you introduce channels.The key difference with classical (fully-connected neural nets) is that convolution enables parameter sharing, so you no longer have ""edges"" (parameters) connecting each input node to each output node, but rather you build each output node (pixel) by sliding your (parametrised) kernel across the input nodes (pixels)."

Why do LLMs need massive distributed training across nodes -- if the models fit in one GPU while batch decreases the variance of gradients?,"
Why do large language models (LLMs) need massive distributed training across nodes -- if the models fit in one GPU and larger batch only decreases the variance of gradients?
tldr: assuming for models that don't need sharding across nodes, why do we need (massive) distributed training if the models (e.g. CLIP, Chinchilla, even really large GPTs e.g. CLIP fits in a V100 32GB) fit in one GPU and larger batch only decreases the variance of gradients (but not expose ore tokens or param updates)? A larger batch doesn't necessarily mean we train on ""more data/tokens"" -- or at least that doesn't seem to be wrt SGD like optimizers.

Intuitively, it feels that if we had a larger batch size then we have more tokens to learn about -- but knowing some theory of optimization and what SGD like algorithms actually do -- a larger batch size only actually decreases the variance of gradients. So to me it's not clear why massie distributed training is needed -- at all unless the model is so large that it has to be shared across nodes. In addition, even if the batch was ""huge"" -- we can only do a single gradient update.
I feel I must be missing something obvious hence the question given how pervasive massive distributed training is.
In addition some toy training curves with V100s & T5's show me there is very little if any benefit in additional GPUs

In addition, it seems from nonGPT we know small batch sizes are sufficient to train (reference https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT but I did ask Karpathy directly to confirm  https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT/issues/58).
I am missing something obvious, but I wanted to clear this up in my head since it seems to be a foundation thing in training foundation models.
Related to the previous, I've also been unsure about the role of the batch size in training LLMs compared to traditional deep learning. In traditional deep learning when we used epochs to train, a model the larger the batch size the quicker we could go through an epoch -- so the advice I received (e.g. approximate advice by Ruslan Salakhutdinov's at the Simon's institute for deep learning tutorials) was to make the batch size large. Intuitively, the larger the batch size the more data the model sees per iteration. But mathematically this only really improves the variance of the gradient -- which isn't immediately obvious is what we want (I've done experiments and seen papers where noisy gradients lead to better models).
It is clear too the that the larger the context size the better (for everything, but for the sake of this conv it's better for training) -- whenever possible.  But context size is totally different from batch size. So my question is, how does distributed training, especially at the node level help at all if batch size isn't really the helping factor (which might be a wrong assumption)? So the only role for distributed training I see is if the model is to large to fit in 1 node -- since I'm arguing there is no point to make the batch size too large (I'd guess 64-32 is fine due to the CLT).
What am I missing? Empirical answers are fine! Or any answers are fine!

Why are neural networks so data hungry?,"
Stephen Wolfram published an interesting long post on machine learning this week.
He illustrates a function approximation application with the following target function, piecewise flat with three regions.

I understand one can describe such a function with five parameters, the three constant levels (initially low, high in the middle and mid on the right) and the two discontinuity points.
As a network architecture, the following picture is given.

If my count is right, there are 19 weights (4+12+3 arrows) and 8 biases (count of all neurons but the input one, 4+3+1), totalling 27 parameters. The activation function is said to be ReLU for all neurons.
With this frame, we have 27 parameters in the model to estimate a 5 parameter function.
The following image illustrates how the model fits the function as the number of examples grows.

From 10 thousand examples to 10 milion examples. The magnitude of data required is much higher than the complexity of the target function and the approximating network.

How should this (dis)proportion of data to problem parameters be understood?

",['neural-networks'],"One example or sample is basically a pair of data $(x_i, y_i)$ with $x_i$ randomly picked from x axis and $y_i$ from the piecewise function. As you can see, it doesn't provide a lot information to calculating the weighting factors. By 10,000,000 randomly samples, one may capture the turning points. But if it is not randomly sampled, I would guess the number of sample can be less. The process is different from calculating model parameters from the piecewise function parameter as the neural net doesn't know it is a piecewise function as a priori. The function it expects is a general function, which can be very complex."

Sorry if that is a dumb question. I just started to learn about machine learning.

"Can PPO be applied when the environment is ""input-driven""?","
I'm reimplementing an RL paper about learning a job scheduling policy that acts so as to minimize average job completion time. They claim that this is an ""input-driven"" problem, i.e. much of the variance in rewards is due to the randomness in job arrival sequences, rather than the policy's actions. They deal with this by computing advantages using ""input-dependent"" baselines. During each training iteration, they have $N$ rollout workers running in parallel on the same job arrival sequence, and after all the rollouts are collected, time-based baselines are computed as follows:
$$b(t) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \hat{r}^i(t) \quad \forall t\geq0$$
where $\hat{r}^i(t)$ is some continuous interpolation (e.g. piecewise linear) of the discounted returns $\{r^i_t\}_{t\in\mathcal{T}^i}$ at time $t$ from rollout $i$, where $\mathcal{T}^i \subset \mathbb{R}$ is the set of simulator wall-times of each step in rollout $i$. Then, advantages are computed for each rollout as
$$A^i_t = r^i_t - b(t) \quad \forall t\in\mathcal{T}^i, \forall i\in[N].$$
Since the baselines are computed only as a function of the current training iteration's job arrival sequence, they claim that the variance problem is eliminated. I think this is an interesting approach, and I haven't seen it elsewhere, though I admit I am very new to RL.
Once the advantages are computed, they learn from all the data collected in rollouts $i=1,\ldots,N$ in a single step using REINFORCE, i.e.
$$\theta \gets \theta + \alpha \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{t\in \mathcal{T}^i} A^i_t\nabla_\theta \log \pi_\theta(a^i_t | s^i_t).$$
I am wondering: is PPO suitable for this problem? Could it work well using these advantage calculations instead of using a critic network? If not, could a critic network be configured so as to reduce variance in a similar way, i.e. taking into account only the current job sequence? Thanks!

Is it always a good idea to use deterministic policies during testing?,"
I frequently see people setting deterministic = True while testing an RL algorithm. But is this the right approach? For instance, what happens if the agent plays rock, paper, and scissors? In this case, as per game theory, a stochastic (random) policy is required (as per my understanding)
Edit - Let me clarify my understanding of stochastic and deterministic policies. A deterministic policy will always select an action given some state. The stochastic policy will sample the action given a state. Therefore in the latter case, an optimal policy for Rock, Paper and Scissor will always choose an action with probability of 0.33.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'deep-rl', 'policy-gradients']","Is it always a good idea to use deterministic policies during testing?No, it's not, and you correctly point out that in certain scenarios the optimal policy is stochastic.Specifically, the optimal policy in Rock-Paper-Scissors is a stochastic policy. However, this game can't really be represented as a stationary MDP, but as a Markov Game with 2 players. If you wanted to represent it as an MDP (Markov Game with 1 player), then it might not be stationary, i.e. the dynamics could change.Having said that, there's a known result in the theory of MDPs that says that there's at least one optimal policy that is stationary and deterministic, but there are other environments and models other than finite MDPs. You also have POMDPs, Markov Games, etc., which are generalisations of finite MDPs to different scenarios (partial observability of the state and multiple players, respectively).So, when should you use deterministic policies? Well, most likely, when you are sure that your environment is a finite MDP. It's possible that, when they use deterministic policies, people assume the environment can be represented as an MDP, while, in reality, maybe it's not. Then, of course, in practice, you lose all theoretical guarantees."

Which Q function do we use to make our policy when using double Q learning?,"
I know this might be arbitrary, but I couldn't find any good information on this. As we update 2 q function in double q learning I was curios whether we average, or sum them together to get our policy. Or whether we choose one over the other. It seems to me that when playing around with it typically one of the q functions would outperform the sum or average of both q functions.
","['reinforcement-learning', 'q-learning']","It's kind of a free choice since the main rules for the behaviour policy are thatIt should cover all possible choices. This is handled outside of the Q function by adding some randomnessFor learning efficiency it should be close to the target policy. This is a loose, nice to have, requirement.So any of the current Q being learned should do as the basis of $\epsilon$-greedy behaviour policy. Using average or alternating between them also works, but there is no requirement to match to the one being updated or the one being used to generate the maximising action for the update.The estimators are expected to converge to approximations of the true optimal action value function, with only minor differences, so you could use either at the end.Using both and averaging them might offer a small boost to accuracy (similar to aggregating estimators in other scenarios)."
How to train a neural network in a RL environment to learn the optimal strategy in tic tac toe?,"
I have just been diving into machine learning since last week. I'm trying to create a neural network that learns to play tic tac toe optimally in an RL environment. So far with very little success. Some iterations of my network did converge to some winning strategy, but not the optimal one. And some other iterations of my network didn't converge to any kind of winning strategy at all.
So here's my setup:
My neural network takes 9 inputs, each input having one of these possible values:

0 for an empty cell
+1 for a cell filled by the NN's agent
-1 for a cell filled by the opponent's agent

Then it has a few fully connected hidden layers, all using the tanh activation function. And finally it has 9 outputs which are supposed to represent the q-values for each move, each ranging from -1 to +1.
I'm still experimenting with what opponent to use. These are the options I'm experimenting with:

An agent that plays 100% randomly.
An agent that plays 100% optimally.
An agent that plays 80% optimally and 20% randomly.
An agent using another instance of the same neural network, which I then also train, so that it hopefully eventually plays better and better.

While I'm letting the players play a game, I use the epsilon-greedy method to make sure that the NN's agent sometimes explores a random move. I let the players play a game until it is finished, and I record a history of each state + action taken at each step in the game. Then when the game is finished, I loop through the history, from the end to the beginning, and I train the neural network(s) to correct their predicted q-values.
That code looks something like this:
trainOnce() {
  // play moves until the game is finished
  while (this.playNextMove());

I was hoping that this should work well enough. But it doesn't, and I can't quite figure out why. Even after letting it play 300,000 games, the neural network does not seem to get significantly better.
Can anybody see any glaring mistakes in my approach and / or code? Is my trainOnce() function wrong? Or should I configure my neural network differently? Should I use a different activation function than tanh? A different data encoding for the input? Or should I use a different topology? (The topologies I've tried are [9, 18, 9] and [9, 18, 18, 9].) Or should I try some convolutional layers to treat the board grid as if it's an image? Any help would be appreciated.

"NN Architecture for the detection of ""sparse"" Objects","
I have a document digitalization task where I want to detect technical drawings from images. These Images mostly consist of objects made up of combination of shapes like lines, circles and rectangles. See this example: .
What I want as the result is a detection of all ""objects"" in this image like e.g. switches, wirings and devices that are present.
I already tried multiple network architectures like:

YOLO
DeepLab
UNet (for Pixel based classification)

Generally I observe that all these approaches work well for small objects but have big problems with ""bigger"" objects due to their ""sparsity"". I guess thats not surprising if you consider the nature of CNNs.
One one hand my task seems simple due to things like

high contrast
limited set of shapes (or ""poses"") for the different objects

But I think CNNs all have problems with the ""sparseness"" of the objects as its only the boundary that is detectable and the inner is often empty.
Has anyone here an Idea which architectures to try or links to papers to read for these kinds of problems?
Ideally I would like to get the list of objects as output but I am unsure how to encode this in the NN as e.g. YOLO does this by an approach that would not work in my scenario, I think (merging all ""inner"" boxes that show the same object).
Thanks already!

Is there a metric to compare BOW vs TFIDF results?,"
I am working on a document search task and have used Bag of Words (BOW) and TFIDF vectorization techniques. My observation after going through some sample searches are -

Both of them seem to provide similar results when we look at top X results for a given search term.
However, in some cases BOW might give a slightly better top X results compared to TFIDF and vice versa.
The cases in which TFIDF is slightly better is comparatively more than cases in which BOW is slightly better.

I wish to select either of the two and based on above eyeballing I decided to go with TFIDF. But this is not explainable since the decision is based on individual perspective after looking at some sample cases. I would like to know if there is some kind of metric that I can make use of to arrive at a decision? Since eyeballing can lead to biased decision.

"""Attention is all you need"" paper : How are the Q, K, V values calculated?","
The seminal Attention is all you need paper introduces Transformers and implements the attention mecanism with ""queries, keys, values"", in an analogy to a retrieval system.
I understand the whole process of multi-head attention and such (i.e., what is done with the Q, K, V values and why), but I'm confused on how these values are computed in the first place. AFAICT, the paper seems to completely leave that out.
Both Figure 2 of the paper and equations explaining Attention and Multihead attention start with Q,K,V already there :

The answers regaridng the origin of Q,K,V I've found so far haven't satisfied me :

In this similar question, the accepted answer says ""The proposed multihead attention alone doesn't say much about how the queries, keys, and values are obtained, they can come from different sources depending on the application scenario."".

I also see some answers (eg this one on the same question) which say that Q, K and V are the result of multiplication of the input embedding with some matrices. This is also what is shown in the popular blog post The Illustrated Transformer :



Why isn't the computing of Q,K,V -be it ""left to the application"" or ""multiplication with matrices"" made more clear in the paper, at the very least for the task of language translation for which they show some results and so obviously did compute Q,K,V in some way ? If it is matrix multiplication, are these matrices ($W^Q$, etc in the figure of the blog post) trained with backprop jointly with the rest of the network or pretrained ? What are the resulting shapes of Q,K,V ?
","['transformer', 'attention', 'word-embedding']","(OP auto-answer) After having dug further in and read more papers on attention, and with help from Chillston in the comments, I think I've got it narrowed down to an issue of confusing notation. If anyone thinks this is not the right answer, please don't hesitate to submit another one, which I'll mark as correct if I think it's better.Q, K and V values are defined in the paper, and they do come from multiplication with learnt matrices. Those matrices are $W^Q_i$, $W^K_i$ and $W^V_i$, defined in section 3.2.2 of the paper.The confusion stems from the fact that the notation used in the multihead attention equation and in Figure 2 (right) of the paper is wrong/confusing.
The equation would be be clearer if it read :

And Figure 2 right could be modified accordingly :
In this new notation, $X$ and $Y$ are the inputs to the current attention unit.Technically, the way it's written in the paper could be correct but you need to consider that $Q, K, V$ refer to different tensors when they're written :"
How to derive the variance of the forward step of Variational Diffusion Models in terms of the log signal-to-noise ratio $\lambda_t$?,"
Regarding Eq. (1) in Progressive Distillation for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Models,
$$
q(\mathbf{z}_t|\mathbf{z}_s) = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z}_t; (\alpha_t/\alpha_s)\mathbf{z}_s, \sigma _{t|s}^2 \mathbf{I})

$$
, it says $\sigma_{t|s}^2 = (1 - e^{\lambda_t - \lambda_s})\sigma_t^2$.
I believe $\sigma_{t|s}$ is from DDPM's $\beta$, then it's equivalent to $1 - \alpha_t^2 / \alpha_s^2$ here. Note that $\lambda_t = \log (\alpha_t^2 / \sigma_t^2)$. As far as I understand, $\sigma_t^2 + \alpha_t^2 = 1$. Maybe I'm taking something wrong.
Anyway, how could $\sigma_{t|s}^2 = (1 - e^{\lambda_t - \lambda_s})\sigma_t^2$ be derived from $1 - \alpha_t^2 / \alpha_s^2$?
Some more notes.

More papers are using the same expression.

I think the definition of $\sigma_{t|s}$ Eq. (22) in the original VDM paper is straightforward with respect to DDPM's definitions.

What is the motivation for using Q-Learning in RL?,"
In Spinning Up by OpenAI, it says the following regarding policy optimization methods and Q-Learning as ways of getting a good policy for RL.

Trade-offs Between Policy Optimization and Q-Learning. The primary strength of policy optimization methods is that they are principled, in the sense that you directly optimize for the thing you want. This tends to make them stable and reliable. By contrast, Q-learning methods only indirectly optimize for agent performance, by training $Q_{\theta}$ to satisfy a self-consistency equation. There are many failure modes for this kind of learning, so it tends to be less stable. But, Q-learning methods gain the advantage of being substantially more sample efficient when they do work, because they can reuse data more effectively than policy optimization techniques.

What I am wondering is the motivation behind Q-Learning in this sense; I understand that when it works, it can be nice getting better sample efficiency, but what I don't understand is why Q-Learning was even considered in the first place as a way to approximate the optimal policy. It seems counterintuitive to me to have something I want to optimize and then to not optimize it, but rather optimize something else.
In other words, why does Q-learning work when it does?
","['reinforcement-learning', 'deep-rl', 'q-learning']","First, you asked why Q-Learning was considered. The reason is that it was a big revolution in the history of RL and the best method for a variety of problems at the time (1989, Watkins). Policy optimization was only introduced later by R. Williams in 1992.There are some points where Q-Learning can have some advantages over policy optimization algorithms:Why does Q-Learning work:
In general reinforcement learning problems can be modeled by the Bellman equation:
\begin{equation}
q_{\pi}(s, a) = \mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left[\sum_{a}\pi(a|s)\sum_{r, s'}p(s', r|s,a)[r+\gamma v(s')]\right].
\end{equation}
Problems like this can be tackled with various methods like dynamic programming, monte carlo methods or temporal difference methods, which combines the previous two. Q-Learning is a temporal difference method and there are theoretical proofs showing that it converges to optimality under certain conditions.The problems of Q-Learning are more practical nature:"
Why do training and fixing a reservoir yield very similar results (in an echo state network)?,"
Disclaimer: I asked this question 2 days ago in Cross Validated, but it has been left unanswered.

I am trying to better understand how echo state networks work. To see, how fixing the weights of the reservoir of an echo state network impacts the prediction quality of an echo state network, I have conducted a very simple experiment using ESN layer of the tensorflow-implemented Keras having the two models below:
model_untrainable = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tfa.layers.ESN(units= 1000, spectral_radius=0.99, trainable=False),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer=""lecun_normal"")
])

model_trainable = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tfa.layers.ESN(units= 1000, spectral_radius=0.99),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, kernel_initializer=""lecun_normal"")
])

So, as one sees, the only difference is that in the model_trainable, the reservoir's weights are allowed to be updated during training, but in the model_untrainable, they are just fixed (by setting trainable=False). My hypothesis was that the model_trainable should be way better because its settable parameters are more than those of the model_untrainable. So, using identical setting for optimizers, loss functions, and regularization and taking monthly sunspots dataset into account, here are the predictivity results of the cited models.
model_trainable:

model_untrainable:

It seems that the untrainable_model is almost as good as the model_trainable. Why is that the case? In other words, shouldn't the trainable_model significantly better than the untrainable_model?
","['recurrent-neural-networks', 'keras', 'echo-state-network', 'reservoir-computing']","trainable = False is a hardcoded setting for each ESN layer in esn_cell.py. So, regardless of what one sets in any usage of ESN, its corresponding reservoir cannot be trained."

Why is the term divided by $m$? Looking at other sources I don't see $m$ in the denuminator. Why would we want smaller weights when the batch size is bigger?

Training a neural network to produce a relative score of input values,"
I am considering training a neural network to place a number of data items into a list ordered by priority, so that the most important items are dealt with first and the least important are dealt with last.  My training data will consist of pairs of items (A and B) and expected outputs with categories: ""item A first"", ""item B first"", or ""order of these items is not important"".
I can obviously train the network to simply categorize the pairs of items, but in operation this will be inefficient: if I have a large list of items to sort, I'll need to run  $O(n \log n)$ pairs of items through the network to sort the list, so for example given a 64 item list, we'd have to run the network 384 times.
I wonder if it is possible to train a network that produces a single score that I can use a proxy for the items and just sort based on those scores.  Then I'd only have to run the network once for each item in the list and use a traditional sorting method to sort the list.  But how can I train such a network without knowing in advance what the scores should be?  The only useful information I have is that I know pairs of inputs $A$ and $B$ such that $s(A) > s(B)$, but not the actual values themselves. I could arbitrarily assign numbers myself, but this could result in data that is harder for the network to learn than is necessary.
Is there a special training architecture or loss function I could use that would allow me to train the network to produce such numbers without needing to fix their actual value in advance?

Backpropagation with multiple output neurons but only one loss value,"
Suppose we have the following neural network (in reality it is a CNN with 60k parameters):

This image, as well as the terminology used here, is borrowed from Matt Mazur
As is visible, there are two neurons in the output layer, namely o1 and o2. However, I do not have labels for these neurons. Rather, I have another neural network that evaluates this output layer and return one value that indicates the ""goodness"". As such, it is impossible to calculate the individual errors for o1 and o2, but it is possible to use aforementioned goodness as total error (i.e., the sum of the errors for o1 and o2). Thus, as I see it, every term in the following chain-rule formula can still be calculated:

(And a similar formula for o2.)

What does Deep Q-Learning (DQL) do?,"
Hello :) I'm required to write a document where I describe what DQL does in short.
This is what I wrote:
DQL: instead of a Q-table, a DNN is used to approximate the Q-values for each action based on a given state. Bear in mind that, we seek to find the optimal Q-value for a state-action pair at a time slot t, written as  $Q^* (s_t,a_t)$, which obeys the Bellman equation:
$$Q^*(s_t, a_t)=E\left [ R_{a_t}(s_t,s')+\gamma max_{a_{t+1}}Q^*(s_{t+1},a_{t+1}) \right ]$$
Where $Q^* (s_{t+1},a_{t+1})$ is the optimal Q-value for the next state-action pair $(s_{t+1},a_{t+1})$. The parameters of the DNN are updated every time step t, aiming to find the optimal policy $π^*=argmax_{a_t} Q^* (s_t,a_t)$ that maximizes the reward.
Is what I wrote correct? Should I say we seek to find the optimal Q-value for a state action pair at a time slot t or should I say we seek to train the DNN to resemble the optimal Q-value for a state action pair at a time slot t? Which one is correct?
